<title>SGOYT made me buy this!</title>
<description>Hello!

The [thread=986303]Solitaire Games on Your Table geeklists[/thread] are really a great ressource for solitaire gamers. However, they are also a bane for our purses as they point out all those new games we could purchase. And regularly, we cave in.

This is a list to commemorate those moments where we were bewitched but also to get a feeling for the power of those geeklists.

So, feel free to list the items you bought because of the geeklists, maybe commenting on the item or the circumstances of the purchase or whatever comes to mind.

Yours,
Deathworks</description>

	<body>Hello!

Well, I guess this will be a regular guest as its repeated appearance on the recent lists made it somewhat hard to miss. The tales people told about their experiences really wet my mouth and when I had the opportunity, I made the move and bought the game.

That is definitely a purchase I do not regret.

Yours,

	<body>Hello!

Actually, I ordered [thing=34119]the new version[/thing] after reading the exciting reports of what was going on in the game, but good fortunes allowed me to buy the original version.

This is another purchase I do not regret and which makes me thankful for these geeklists.

	<body>Hello!

Well, this game made a very sudden but successful appearance. I had seen its box at my local game store, but the number of players (2-4) made it a no-go for me, despite my interest in civilization games. And then, [b]Shaun[/b] posted a report on the geeklists, mentioning his collection of the solo variants site members had developed.

The game became an immediate purchase and I found it to be great fun, although I decided to device a solo variant of my own.

Special thanks go not only to the lists, but also to [user=ShaunGamer][/user]!

Yours,
Deathworks</body>

	<body>Hello!

This is another curious case of a game sitting in the shelf at my local game store and me coming across it on the lists. I have to admit that I had not really looked at it in the store, but then it got posted on the lists, I think by [b]Kyle[/b]. Later reports with photos showing a modular board and the hints of various strategies together with the link to [thing=71544][/thing] made me want this game.

As with [b]Clash of Cultures[/b], I felt the necessity to adjust the solo rules a bit to my needs, but I found the play quite enjoyable.

Thus, thanks to the lists and [user=Woelf][/user]!

	<body>Hello!

This was kind of a small assault by the geeklists. Basically, the lists made me aware of the existence of this game and in turn made me investigate it. And then I came across it at my local game store!

So, this was another good game the geeklists&apos; subtle influence led me to.

	<body>Hello!

About this one, I am not quite sure anymore, but I think that I also saw the game first on one of the lists. And further investigations made this a must-buy for me. And yes, it turned out to be just as good as I hoped (and I can&apos;t wait for the arrival of my copy of [thing=130704][/thing]).

	<body>Hello!

This one was actually a game of cat and mouse for me. The initial reports were all about playing multiple characters and it otherwise being too difficult. But then, there came hints that true solo would be possible.

I was intrigued, because I had noticed the huge box at my local store quite a while ago, and the shiny &quot;1-&quot; for the number of players was unforgettable. When people seemed to confirm the true solo option, I went for the kill.

I have not played a complete, regular game of it yet, but came very close to finishing one. Still, I have found that it is playable and winnable in true solo mode, so I am very happy with the lists leading to this game, which has a lot of story potential (although only war stories (^_^;; ).

	<body>Hello!

This is another game still awaiting its first complete, regular play, although I also got close to finishing it once. I am not quite sure whether I really like it, as it seems to be very challenging, but then again, the comments on the geeklists included sufficient warning.

Well, this is one of the triad of island games that made regular appearances on the geeklists, and the idea of getting a story telling game, had me hooked quite easily.

Whether that is a winner for me is yet to be seen, however.

	<body>SE4X was my temptation and I succumbed and bought, although I did get my wife to treat it as a Birthday pressie, so that I felt less guilty :blush:. 

I am learning the rules now and hope to get it to the table today. It&apos;s taking me a bit of time to do so because of time spent out at games nights recently (I only have so much free time).

I have never played a hex and counter game before, so I am in for a novel experience either way. The rules are really enticing, not at all dry. So I am eager to dive in and take on the Doomsday Machines.

	<body>I have been aware of this for years, but it didn&apos;t display itself as a game I would like.
It appeared on geeklists. Friends purchased it. It seemed to have a following. However, I never felt the need to play or even look at it.
Then it started appearing on the SGoYT geeklist.
I still wasn&apos;t interested although some of the session reports sounded good.

Then I compiled the [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArPn6kvlGsLSdGtHdjZlc0IwMDlVWUdBa29xaER2bWc&amp;usp=sharing]SGoYT Spreadsheet[/url] and discovered it was ranked near the top of the list.
This sent me on a hunt to find out more about the game and the people who play it solitaire.
I quickly realised it was not the all-consuming, money-gobbling Monster that some card games have become, so decided to take the plunge.

[COLOR=#990000]This has easily become one of the more enjoyable solitaire experiences I have in my collection.[/COLOR]

I have spent some money on two expansions and the first Saga box (Only because they were on Christmas specials I couldn&apos;t refuse!) 
The base game still has plenty of legs and I doubt I will get into the extra purchases until sometime later next year.

	<body>Hello!

This game also came to my home only because of people on the lists mentioning it. By myself, I would never have searched through the geek for a game like this.

This was a really fortunate purchase as I have found this to be very quick to play and quite exciting as an experience. And I recently found out that even if beating level 1 seems fairly easy, victory at level 4 is not guaranteed (^_^;;

Now, I won&apos;t buy any new games until I hit my milestones. :whistle:</body>

	<body>Hello!

Yes, the SGoYT lists made me buy this game as so many people reported of its glory, together with some nice photos.

And I have to say, they were absolutely correct about this game, it is really great.

The only problem I have is that at least the German version I was forced to buy in my local store (since I am reluctant to order unless absolutely necessary) had, despite different images on the back of the box, grey POI tokens with really ugly victim graphics that always make me shudder much more than any hotspot or endangered hazmat token (^_^;;

I finally snagged this at a decent price, after watching everyone else (like a kid with his dirty little face pressed up against the window of the candy shoppe) buying and enjoying it over the past few months. 

It showed up yesterday. 

I finished up a game of [thing=127518]A Distant Plain[/thing] (thanks SGoYT!) yesterday and then gave [thing=71721]Space Hulk: Death Angel[/thing] (thanks SGoYT!) a quick drive around the block, but this is now out and on my table waiting for me to learn and play it.

After an inventory of the chits I came up with 217 of 218. It appears all I am missing is a parachute chit, which I assume does not affect gameplay. Now time to get this to the table and attempt to learn the rules. If this one turns out to be a hit, I can only hope the expansions are not too brutally expensive. </body>

	<body>Sooner or later I might have come to realize that if it&apos;s a co-op game you can solo it.  But in Freedom&apos;s case, I had been hearing buzz about it for several months before seeing it on SGOYT and realizing that even if my family didn&apos;t like it I could still get a fair amount of play out of it.  As soon as it was in my grubby paws, I was very happy with my decision.  It&apos;s a thought-provoking, challenging experience that I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t miss out on.

	<body>When I saw this pop up on CSI&apos;s Daily Sale, I went ahead and purchased it based on the response I&apos;ve seen in SGoyT.  $12.99 was a good price. :)

Really impressed with the components being it&apos;s Victory Point Games. I also chuckled at the fact a napkin was included to wipe off the soot from the laser cutting, and at the irony that I was wiping off soot from game components from a game about mining. :P I also glued the pawns to their bases since they easily slipped off when I picked them up.

Looking forward to trying this out.</body>

	<body>Despite the seemingly low number in circulation this kept popping up on the lists and piqued my interest.  Quite by chance I happened upon one for sale online (I wasn&apos;t searching for it, honest) and though it was pricey I decided to do what the fates (and SGoYT) obviously wanted me to.  Reader, I bought it.

Almost immediately I had buyers remorse - was the game actually any good?  I had some palpitations, a slight sweat on the brow, I began calculating all the other things I could do with that money.  I was not expecting a good nights sleep.

Then, the fates sent another message in the form of an extremely well timed [thread=1196103]review by 1PG regular Withnails liver[/thread].  The world righted, and I slept like a log.

SGoYT giveth and SGoYT taketh away.

	<body>Hello!

Well, I have been guilty of neglecting this list myself, so I probably have a little catching up to do.

Unfortunately, among my recent purchases was one that I find a bit disappointing. Figuring to put good flavour over the bad, I decided to start with it, and this is it.

I became aware of this item via the [listitem=3204263]May list[/listitem]; there was no big advertising there, so I don&apos;t put any blame or anything there. It was my own curiosity that got the better of me.

Anyhow, the product itself advertises with a solo option, so you would expect it to be something big. Unfortunately, the setup of the mechanisms does not really combine well in my eyes with a solo option. And things got a bit weird when you were asked to play both as the GM and the player(s)... after all, if you went down that road, couldn&apos;t you just play any RPG by default solo?

Well, the item does provide a few tools like its conversation tables, and it is obviously indebted to [thing=47392][/thing], using a simplified version of its fate table. But all in all, the solo option doesn&apos;t sound really exciting to me. Especially the suggestions for handling hidden information/mysteries leave me wondering about their worth...

Maybe I should elaborate on the mechanisms to make the problems there more clearly. This guide book provides rules and tables to design a story arc adventure over 3 (or some other number) acts. It helps structure your normal adventure design process, and is probably good at encouraging an exciting structure. The tables are genre specific, so its usefulness is somewhat limited if you don&apos;t go for fantasy, science fiction, or horror, but within those genre, I think the tables offer quite a lot of variance and are probably very good at getting those creative juices flowing.

In order to create this structured adventure, the guide uses a top down approach - first you define the main conflict of the adventure, the main situations and so on, and then you create the individual scenes. Of course, this means that in the basic variant, all mysteries are known right at the start as they are the basis for the later scenes. They are the first thing you determine, in a way.

The solo section does not change anything with the mechanisms/structure, but instead suggests working with multiple possibilities (the example given was about suspects) and randomly eliminate them one by one until one remains or until you have the showdown to randomly to pick one. Putting it bluntly, this solution feels rather tacked on and goes against the grain of the well-structured adventures. In addition, either you work really hard to keep all suspects reasonably in play or you risk ending up with contradictions in the end when the suspect would have had a chance to achieve there goal much earlier or maybe send the PCs on a false track. 

In my eyes, that solo option is rather problematic (besides being weird in telling you to multiplayer solo right away), which bothers me more than the completely meaningless one act variant or the repeated mix-up between &quot;then&quot; and &quot;than&quot; and similar things.

Nice ideas/aids for adventure design in my eyes, but not really a good concept for solo gaming.

Yours,
Deathworks</body>

	<body>Hello!

Well, this one came up regularly on the lists, and eventually, I simply broke down and allowed it to become mine.

Although I am not really a fan of miniatures, those that come with the game are okay. I really don&apos;t like the mono-coloured PC sheets, though (T_T)

The game out of the box is probably simple enough, but it really invites adjusting things, and before long, I began to experiment with my own variants - and it was quite satisfying.

	<body>Hello!

After getting Ashardalon, I immediately also got this one to get the benefit of mixing the components. Indeed, it really seems as if these two games are best when combined as each has nice bonus features.

I have to admit that I am still reluctant to go out trying to beat up Strahd (I mastered a [family=534]Ravenloft[/family] campaign in [family=244]AD&amp;D 2nd edition[/family] for years with a lot of restraint on loot and PC powers, so even domain lords were untouchable, let alone legends like Strahd).

	<body>Hello!

Yes, I also got the third game, as it was also a regular on the lists.

However, I have yet to really give it a try as there are no map tile cards available (I prefer them as it is easier to shuffle cards than map tiles).

So, there is not much to comment about from my side, although I am a bit disappointed that there is no drider boss in it...

Yours,

	<body>Hello!

This has been purchased a little while ago, but I still see it as a great game. The somewhat silly title and the cover art really made me stay away from this one for quite a while. But reports on the geeklists first sparked my interest and eventually convinced me to make the move.

It is interesting that most people consider it a puzzle game. It does not really feel like a puzzle in my eyes. Personally, it is much more of a thematic game - and a very good one at that.

Yours,
Deathworks</body>

	<body>So, I became aware of the existence of Sentinels right after I officially discovered solo gaming about 18 months ago. It interested me, but at the time the word on the street seemed to be that it was not really the greatest game for solo play. My interest faded again, right up until I started following SGOYT and joined 1PG. There I saw it mentioned again and again and again and again. The game that I had understood was not a great solo game was an SGOYT superstar. And now there is even a Sentinels challenge in 1PG!

I bought a copy of the base game and the first few expansions from Mo, and it&apos;s become my latest obsession. It&apos;s not an especially deep game, but it&apos;s undeniably fun and VERY superheroic. I&apos;m thinking about buying more expansions, looking at the fan-created decks, and even taking an interest in the new Sentinels Tactics game. They say it isn&apos;t made for solo. I say they must not have met 1 Player Guild yet. If there is ANY way to play it solo, we will find it. And we will play it. Solo.</body>

	<body>Hello, my name is Ryan and I love games. I recently went on a spending spree, and it doesn&apos;t seem to be over. 

I bought [thing=66781][/thing], [thing=122702][/thing], [thing=148007][/thing], [thing=14017][/thing], and a second copy of [thing=100901][/thing] from Michael&apos;s auction. 

I bought [thing=60435][/thing] from Kevin. 

Tonight I bought [thing=3807][/thing] off eBay. This was part of a really good package deal with two other games.  I&apos;m hoping I can sell the other games to pay for Smokejumpers, but we&apos;ll see. 

Don&apos;t forget, I backed [thing=134253][/thing] and [thing=162616][/thing] on Kickstarter. 

I&apos;m also expecting that I&apos;ll break down and order [thing=140620][/thing] in the next day or two. 

Woo, this is a lot of new stuff. I also just got [thing=136063][/thing], but that was given to me.

So many games!!!</body>

	<body>I have kept meaning to come over here and post something and now I finally have.

Mainly so I can make all you SGOYT posters feel bad about making me spend money. You are all evil and what makes it worse is that you know what you are doing. :D

Just pulled the trigger and bought this. I was interested in this and then I read all the bad KS stuff and watched some reviews about how bad it is and then I walked away. SGOYT brought it back. It&apos;s not posted about a lot but the posts are very interesting and it&apos;s different enough to make me want to try it. It&apos;s either going to be a supreme victory or epic failure. This is a Marmite game and I want to find out if it&apos;s for me (I love Marmite).

Also, I&apos;ve recently bought Lewis and Clark, traded for Core Worlds and The Isle of Dr Necreaux because of SGOYT.

I&apos;m not going to talk about all the other games I&apos;ve bought over the last 6 months because of the list. Like I said, you people are evil and your work is never done. :D

Edit: Just bought Galaxy Defenders and Mice &amp;Mystics from the 1 Player Guild Trading Post. Only my empty wallet stopped me from spending more.</body>

	<body> Now, while not on the monthly list a [i]whole[/i] lot, I have seen it, and I particularly would like to [b]blame[/b]  none other than [user=ryanmobile][/user] for this purchase. Saw his post quite a few months back, and it was an &apos;on my radar&apos; item added to my list.

 My FLGS was unable to get this in, and I really prefer to buy locally rather than online, I kinda pushed it back to a &apos;oh well /sadface&apos; loss. I walk in one day, and there is the expansion, [thing=128474][/thing] sitting on the shelf! I lose my stink and get them on it. Turns out they had brought it in with a copy of the main game for some other guy, and reserved it in the back (I guess they finally were able to get it in). I had them call the guy to see if he was coming, and it turns out, he said no (what a nice guy-gets an item ordered in and then decides not to buy :angry:) buuuuut, this was to my benefit. I am finishing the rules now (I have difficulty reading-there, I said it) and close to getting it to the table. I can&apos;t wait! The theme behind this game, to me, is fooking great. I&apos;ve watched [user=rockinghorsedreams][/user] plays of this, and it has me super excited to play! And if it&apos;s to my liking, I know the expansion is sitting there waiting for me!</body>

My first attempt at this was during a bout with the flu and I could barely get through it (I remember nothing!).  I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll get it back on the table this month but I have some leave coming up after this month is over so I&apos;ll be sure to tackle it then.

	<body>Well, actually [user=Ibbo][/user] made me buy this.

In fact that&apos;s a bit harsh. He made me visit the shop &apos;The Works&apos; and have a look around.

I have often gone in to the shop looking for books but never for games until he started talking about it on SGOYT. He bought this game there too.

I decided to pop in today and have a look around and here this was plus a few other multiplayer games that I didn&apos;t get.  I couldn&apos;t resist at the price (a tenner) and so now I have it.

And another shop I won&apos;t be able to walk past without popping my head in and probably spending money. Poop.

I got some cash back from my annual tax declaration and I could have used it wisely... But I went to cologne and visited one of my favorite gaming stores from which I normally buy here on BGG. That alone made me buy Mound Builders, [thing=84465][/thing], [thing=149361][/thing] and [thing=53093][/thing](more for MP). 

And also because SGOYT List I traded [thing=28143][/thing], bought [thing=34499][/thing] and ordered [thing=140620][/thing].

I really feel bad now and will have to do a lot of house and garden work in the next weeks to avoid any more eyebrows and evil eyes from my girl...

	<body>I purchased four games for $100 on Craigslist this weekend.  I told my wife I need some accountability on my purchases before it gets out of hand.  Thanks SGoYT!  

Craigslist purchase 1 of 4. Got a good price on an opened but new/unpunished copy.  Finally a (hopefully) worthy game to give me my :zombie: fix.</body>

Posting it now because I FINALLY got in a play of the game, and it was [i]fantastic[/i]. Reminds me of Civilization (the computer game) in some ways; lots of fiddly bits and interacting parts. Also, some brutally punishing gameplay, even in Easy Mode.</body>

	<body>Seriously I was not going to buy any more games this month.  Really!!  Then I saw the next wave of Barnes &amp; Noble game clearance.  Castle Ravenloft was listed at half price.  I told myself still not worth it. Then I saw mention of some being able to stack a 30% off coupon.  So I ended up getting this game for about $23 pre tax.  I would not have been interested if I haven&apos;t seen other post their D&amp;D adventure games on the SGoYT thread.  My ameritrash library is growing with this, Galaxy Defenders, and Zombicide.  While I have a feeling the game I&apos;m really seeking is GoW.  Maybe I can get that on the cheap soon too :laugh:</body>

Not really blaming SGOYT for the base-game, but Stig&apos;s mini-challenge the past couple of months (and a rare reasonably priced eBay listing) means I have ordered both Hero Booster and Winter expansions.

Stigs challenges, and the speed/lightness of the game means Basic Heroes have been played 9 times each.</body>

The fact it is an expansionless game is a bonus.  This had 10 plays when new, then was parked for newer games.  However it is definitely scheduled for play this month.

Having a collector streak in me I reckon I will end up buying all the expansions, but for now I have Space Marine Pack 1 waiting to be unwrapped.  Another game scheduled for play this month - with a personal caveat a different Squad-Trio will be used each time, so SMP1 should see the table soon(ish).</body>

	<body>The several reports I read in the list made me seriously regret not to have bitten into this game during its P500 gestation. I had some doubts about how NASCAR racing could translate into game mechanisms (I have never played Formule Dé or Rallyman and my motor racing gaming experience is through very satisfying PC simulations). I ordered it through GMT&apos;s Autumn sale, pre-ordered the 4 track pack and Grand Prix. I have read the rule book and liked what I read. I cannot wait for the game to be delivered now and am ready to be unfaithful to my beloved Flying Colours! :p

Luckily it&apos;s cheap so if it doesn&apos;t work out I won&apos;t feel like hunting anyone down.

	<body>I blame the terror that flaps in the night: [user=garyrbrooks][/user]

He just kept saying how Thunderstone is good, so I decided to get this Numenera version :)

I am still sleeving all the cards (agh) and reading the rules. I don&apos;t seem to find a good video of the gameplay, so I am afraid of getting some rules wrong... But it indeed seems to be a great Solo Game (but really I don&apos;t see playing it with my friends). Any tips?

	<body>The SGoYT Geeklists have made me buy a lot of games over the last year, but this is the final one from my initial 2013 Wishlist. 
(Actually second last one, but the chances of me getting an affordable copy of [thing=47055][/thing] are too small for it to count anymore!)
There has actually been a struggle to pull the trigger on this one, due to the high cost of the either the game or delivery.
However, I eventually found a place with a great price and free shipping, so hopefully it will be worth the wait and anxiety.
Now, I need to find the time to try it out!</body>

	<body>I blame the SGOYT and the TV series NORTH AND SOUTH (never read the books) to same parts for this purchase. The topic interests me a lot and the write ups of games made this sound hard but fun. However, getting this here in Germany would have cost a leg. Thus I had abandoned the game.

Until last Friday in Essen, when talking to the guys at SCHWERKRAFT VERLAG I saw this game sitting behind them on the shelf. Did not take long for some nice Euro bills to change hands for this game.

Btw. There was one booth on the Spiel selling US imports. There were still copies of WHERE THERE IS DISCORD to find - for 99,-€. Did think about it, but will most likely never play as I am not that interested in the topic. 

Biggest fall in price must have been Spielworxx&apos;s DAS BOOT - now selling for 39,-€ instead of the 100+€ it was originally offered for some years back.</body>

I couldn&apos;t really find anything I was too interested in using it on till I saw they had this game. I figured why not?!  So, in a way, I got it for $30 since that $10 credit was given by Paizo and was to pay me back or anything. :)</body>

No really, I can&apos;t wait for this.  I was clipping some counters the other day and I realized using nail clippers and a CD case really hurts my hands.  Plus I noticed that the CD case gets worn down from the clippers.  I decided that I wasn&apos;t going to clip another game until I get one of these, and now it&apos;s coming Wednesday!!!

On an interesting note, you should really check out Oregon Laminations website.  It is straight out of 1995!</body>

However this is a case of another game&apos;s popularity on the list actually forcing me to buy it.
[thing=129437][/thing] is really high in the SGoYT lists (Top 20) but I already have [thing=102652][/thing] (Top 10) and Super Heroes are not really my thing.

	<body>After seeing this appear on November&apos;s geeklist and remembering that it was one of the titles that the manager of my FLGS had acquired at Essen, I started investigating it more whilst waiting for the [url=http://www.thegamescapital.com.au/essen/]Essen titles to arrive[/url].

I dropped [thing=155426][/thing] from my list and decided that this was the title to acquire - I still had plenty of birthday and game sales money to get it.

I had considered backing it on Indiegogo, but held off due to monetary constraints. Just as well as it would have cost me the same if not more as it would have cost me $80 USD, and the exchange arate with the Aussie dollar was bad back then.

I can&apos;t wait to get from work and check it.

I never thought I would enjoy Hex &amp; Counter Games.
SGOYT made me buy Ogre. [i]50% SGOYT, 50% Price as it was the pocket edition.[/i]
Took ~2 months to get to the table. 
Okay this might be the lightest gateway H&amp;C wargame, but :wow:

[b]Oct&apos;s SGOYT[/b] - ATZ had a good AAR after a Lost game, with a good Strategy reply, which planted the seed.
[b]ThirstyMeeples[/b] had discounted it by 50% (Last copy and wanted off the shelf? Not described as such but Selling the cafe copy?).

[i]Had a close call buying it though; hoping to share P&amp;P costs, was looking for other Wishlisted games... but Onirim 2E wasn&apos;t in stock.[/i]</body>

The theme is right up my alley, and most of the negative reviews loved the gameplay but hated the standees. Gameplay is the thing! Plus this cost me $40 instead of Galaxy Defenders, which has minis but cost me $75.

	<body>After buying [thing=142889][/thing] a few weeks ago, I have discovered that I do enjoy wargames. Didn&apos;t find the theme very attractive prior to this, but it turns out that a wargame based around a specific historical event does draw me in after all.

I blame [user=Zouave][/user] for posting an amazing documentary link to SGOYT after I mentioned my potential interest in this game.

Looking forward to getting this to the table.

	<body>Thanks, Kevin. 

Just ordered this after a ton of positive feedback from SGoyT and BGG in general. 

I think it&apos;ll be fun, and I enjoy putting models together. I know it&apos;s derived from Warehammer Quest, and I enjoyed that on the tablet the few times I played it. Kevin also seems to have enjoyed the snot out of it. 

I hope it doesn&apos;t try to compete with Myth.. 

I might need to start an auction for games I&apos;m not playing anymore. </body>

	<body>Well that didn&apos;t last long.

I traded my copy of this to No-E-Mo for Conquest of Planet Earth not too long ago. I felt like with Comancheria coming out, I didn&apos;t need two of these games.

I like Conquest just fine and don&apos;t regret the trade, but the dang top 100 list and you bunch of enablers had me second guessing letting it go at all.

Just saw that someone had put up a Like New copy for 30 bucks. Couldn&apos;t help myself.

	<body>The only reason this game even came to my attention at all was due to occasional reports on the SGOYT monthly lists. But I wasn&apos;t looking to buy it. Certainly had no intention to order it online. Then I found myself in a &quot;brick &amp; mortar&quot; game store, with Myth sitting there on one of the shelves amidst a plethora of other games, beckoning me.

	<body>I already own [thing=71836]Onirim[/thing], so I was trying to avoid even considering the second edition.
However, I have seen it pop up so many times on BGG the last two months that I eventually decided to do some research and participate in the discussions myself. 
What made it worse was finding my original copy and having some really fun sessions playing during my lunch break. 

The final straw was the continued discussion and comments through this month&apos;s SGoYT geeklist.
So when I spotted it at a great price in a local online gaming store, I added it to the cart and hit BUY!

I liked the look of this when Rahdo and OneTAR did their videos, I thought the co-op looked fun but it also looked like a game my wife might enjoy.  Still I put it to the back of my mind.

Now with (no new games in) 2015* looming I was easily swayed by just a couple of recent SGoYT posts.

I solely and totally put the blame on [user=Moe45673][/user] for bringing this game to my attention. Sure, it was not SGoYt but Setting  up a seperate thread just for it in our guild forum is even worse a feat. :)

All kidding aside, I am looking forward to the game. It sounds like a good mix of dungeon crawl and skirmish game which made me back it despite its WWII theme. </body>

	<body>I&apos;ve played some amazing games, this year, and this tiny little game might come out to be my favourite of the lot. Largely impenetrable on release, there are now some excellent tutorials on the game&apos;s website (I&apos;d especially recommend the three flash tutorials) that walk you through the gameplay. It is absolutely worth the investment. 

Fantastic variability each game; a puzzle that rivals the mental challenge of Mage Knight in its best moments. It&apos;s becoming a bit of an obsession already. I&apos;ve recently picked up [thing=126029][/thing] but haven&apos;t added it in yet - and I&apos;ve got the five delve packs on the way, thanks to a combined postage deal. 

Never imagined thus would be the game that kept the sublime [thing=149951][/thing] from getting to the table as much as I&apos;d like. Love this one. 

Thanks, Gary. :D</body>

Well, it was not only the SGoYT lists themselves but also some session report (I can&apos;t recall by whom, but I think it was Mo(e?)) which really caught my attention.

I am not really a big war gamer, but the beautiful planet markers and the flexible board really enthralled me several months ago. And now I pulled the trigger.

	<body>Hello!

I take the liberty of giving it a separate entry despite having done the purchase in one foul swoop.

This one is really mostly SGoYT where people mentioned how much it added to the base game.

And I can confirm that. Just the experience rules add already a whole new dimension to the game, as do the ground troops. And I was even more pleased to see that there were cards in it! Hooray for additional random content!

I have to admit that I don&apos;t find the amoeba scenario too interesting (there is an emotional problem with me and with some of the things in there), although I may look closely at the alien AI.

Anyhow, this was a really good purchase.

But, oh boy, there are even more markers in it (T_T)

There have also been numerous reports on SGOYT over the months about how good it is, so loads of others are to blame too.

It was overpriced and I&apos;m still not sure if it will be my sort of game but I need to try it. If it doesn&apos;t work out for me I know I can find it a home. That being said, I am excited and want to love it.

Watch out for a report on this in January.

A big shout out to Mo. [size=18]Mo![/size] [size=24]MO![/size][user=mo7189][/user]

How dare you to post those pictures of the nice components of the game (T_T)

Add to this that I have been eyeing for a while as my local game store had it for 24.90 Euros with the 4th expansion added for free! Thus, the constant flood of nice images has worn me out.

But it is quite a nice game.

	<body>This thankfully is not a game about playing golf, but is instead a design about designing your own golf course.

Rahdo has a video on this, and after the 1st printing sold out it is now available in a 2nd edition - the designer in the UK responds quickly, and cost + shipping here to the U.S. was a reasonable $35.88.

Well, with all this about randomly generated monsters, this was a game I couldn&apos;t pass when I got the chance to get it.

And after my first play, I think it really is worth the hype.

Besides the outstanding visual look, the fact that it was advertised as 1-2 player made me take notice.

There are a ton of components in this big box. The rules take some time to peruse. The most daunting part of the design is familiarizing oneself with dozens of available actions and a set of different buildings that can be obtained during the course of play.

It&apos;s all setup and ready to go - haven&apos;t played a single turn, yet the journey to get here has already been a fascinating one.</body>

	<body>The fact that FFG has dropped the license for this one finally pushed me into picking it up. My FLGS had it on sale for $40 CDN. Was also lucky enough to find a remaining copy of the Mission Pack 1 expansion at a different local store. FFG is no longer printing the mission pack and no longer has the base game listed on their website. If any of you have been on the fence about this one, it is now or never.

For any Canadians, meeplemart has a bunch of copies of the base game on sale for $40, and 401games has two copies of the mission pack left in stock.</body>

Possibly partly as the puzzler in me is feeling neglected, partly for and monthly games meet (only 3 of us, so Scored Deathmatch will be most likely setup)... knowing there isn&apos;t a Solo AI, also downloaded the Lite Droid version (which works remarkedly well on a 5in screen).</body>

	<body>Having recently purchased [thing=39683][/thing] and loving my solo plays of it, plus playing [thing=119890][/thing] with [user=moe45673][/user] and loving that too, I have realized that perhaps I like Euros (or at least Uwe games) more than I thought I did.

I was considering buying another Euro, something a little bigger than Loyang, when I saw the write up of Fields of Arle by [user=Steve Carey][/user]

Steve&apos;s post intrigued me enough to look into it further. After watching Rahdo&apos;s runthrough, I was sold. Rahdo thought Arle was a good game, but he preferred the pressure and tension of Agricola to the more relaxed sandbox feel of Fields of Arle. I have enough games that are tense and make me feel under pressure ([thing=71721]Space Hulk: Death Angel[/thing], [thing=42776]Gears of War[/thing], [thing=138431]Galaxy Defenders[/thing] and [thing=150658]Pandemic: The Cure[/thing] i am looking at you!). The thought of a sprawling, relaxed Euro with a ton of choices is very appealing right now, and I don&apos;t own any other games like it. I really don&apos;t need any more tactical minis games or dungeon crawlers (at least for a while). 

So I took the money I have saved on cigarettes this week (quit two weeks ago!) and picked it up at my FLGS as a reward for making it another week smoke free!

Thanks Steve, and thanks Moe for continually opening my eyes to types of games that I didn&apos;t think I liked.</body>

[b]Update:[/b] Received today and am partially through stickering the Romans.

Much like clipping, the process is crazy tedious, but I can already tell it&apos;s going to look awesome in play. Can&apos;t wait!

[b]Update 2:[/b] Got the Romans done tonight and decided I wanted to actually play something. With this box came a shiny copy of Battle of Five Armies so I decided to get that out and start reading the rules. Unfortunately, I got really tired reading the rules and decided I&apos;d have preferred to just keep stickering.

I&apos;m really really anxious to play this.

	<body>And [thing=154842][/thing] because in for a penny... 

This is one of the last games I ever would&apos;ve guessed I&apos;d put on this list as in general I&apos;ve grown weary of what I call, MERSC games (move, explore, roll for skill check). I want a bit more sophistication at this point, and I&apos;m well aware that to keep the experience vital, you need to chase expansions for different thematic elements to inspire you when you flip cards. 

I had a bit of an ordeal getting to this point in that I wanted to try-before-buy. Two friends have in shrink copies but would not lend to me because they wanted to keep in shrink for sale. Um, OK. So I figured I&apos;d maybe happen upon a play at some point. But the game reports here kept tempting me as a different option for my solo plays from the heavier stuff I usually prefer, so I decided to order a copy from CSI. Had it in my cart when another friend emailed to say he&apos;d gotten a review copy and did I want him to bring it tomorrow night? Um, OK!

So 5 of us played, got wiped out, and we restarted with one fewer in which we won. Both sessions provoked a lot of groans and shouts of joy, so it was enjoyed. I ordered a copy the next day.

Now that it&apos;s ordered, the next question is will I play this solo or just with others? It sure seems like a bear to set up and tear down by oneself, plus there&apos;s the usual FFG rules questions to deal with. In any case, I&apos;m finding that the more solitaire gaming I do, the more I want social games with my usual group. Whereas I&apos;m usually proposing long, heavy games (Kanban, The Capitals, Martin Wallace stuff, etc.), I could definitely do this again on game night. Or maybe a solitaire play will inspire some story writing out of me; we&apos;ll see, I guess. </body>

	<body>I blame this on all of you that play and post this. I&apos;m just not really into the Aliens theme, so I passed this one up. I love Marvel stuff, so I was really into those (but not so much into playing Villains).  I couldn&apos;t help but keep reading the stuff about this one, so I FINALLY bit down and bought it.

	<body>Not really a solitaire game, but I was curious about it since I used to love Descent. Never got Descent 2.0 so this really was on my radar, but when it started showing up on SGOYT I was like, &quot;Oh crap...&quot;.

	<body>...along with the previous expansion, [thing=149257][/thing], and the collector&apos;s box to fit them all in. PayPal account has been running hot, today. 

This was only a matter of time, frankly, as I love the base game and first expansion (and Nymph promo). As VPG are having a Valentine&apos;s weekend discount, I decided the stars were in alignment. You can infrequently buy these games in the UK, but I just didn&apos;t want to wait for all these latest extras (especially the darkness deck). 

Grabbed the two Poly-Bag versions and couldn&apos;t bear the thought of it all not being in one box. 

Well, that and news of a new boxed expansion coming in the near future. It&apos;s becoming a more manageable Arkham Horror, for me. Sublime game system. </body>

I just couldn&apos;t quite justify the whole bundle with [thing=139131][/thing], although, if I love it, I&apos;ll be back, down the line.

	<body>Hello!

I had actually noticed the game two years ago at the local game store (it was probably there before I got to know the store). Besides the price (which was beyond my budget back then), the photos on it were not really enticing. It looked rather abstract, and while I had played [thing=75934]SimCity[/thing] on the C=64 for hours (F1 was a good friend of mine :) :) :) :) ), I somehow did not feel impressed. Having it sitting in the shelf between historic and modern war games probably added to my reluctance since I am not a war gamer.

Still, I occasionally looked at it, wondering about it.

Then, I got [thing=62219][/thing]. Despite its abstract design, there is quite a bit of flavour to it. And it was by the same designer. So, my interest increased - untill I looked at the photos again and put it away again (^_^;;

And then came [user=enzo622][/user]

In [listitem=3673820]his entry for the January SGoYT list[/listitem], he mentioned the magical word: [i]Randomness[/i]
Truth be told, the entire appearance of the game made me think of one of those war games (remember where it was in the store) where you don&apos;t use any randomizers and instead only calculate the numbers as they are. It seemed like a dry Euro Rosenberg would have loved. 

And now, Kurt came along and said there was randomness in it! And enough to make it extremely swingy! Those words made me drool. Suddenly, the game gained a lot of attention. I downloaded the rulebook, and upon reading it, made the next discovery - you could build things like high schools! While there are those abstract tiles you place on the map, they actually represent diverse buildings!

Okay, so we had randomness there and flavour. Yep, that&apos;s something for the wish list.

Now, I have played my first session. It plays rather long, but I already like it better than [thing=62219][/thing] by the same designer. Just the detail that you will never see all cards in a single session heightens the fun factor of the game for me. And the streets already having names helps with imagining things. And you put all the decks on the board - which is quite good as the GMT boards are all really huge beasts - very nice, but impracticable if you have several card decks.

So, this one gets a big thumbs up from me, a happy customer here indeed.

Yours,
Deathworks</body>

:halfstar: I have to give this one a halfstar, because I honestly cannot remember where I 1st saw this game.  I [b]did [/b]find some info in the Feb and I think Jan SGoYT lists, so it gets a half star.

Ironically, now playing this game, but with a group of 5 others.  See, that&apos;s actually a selling point, you can play solo OR with others.</body>

[q=&quot;StevesArmy&quot;][q=&quot;Wayne LaBanca&quot;]You don&apos;t need &quot;in the lab&quot; to play the solo, I only have the base game and have played these solo rules. I think they added the solo rules to &quot;In the lab&quot; as marketing.
The solo rules work with the base game.[/q]

Brilliant! Thanks for the link. Definitely going to give this a try.

[/q]

Ok, tried it, loved it!

So much so, I started looking again at the expansion itself... ordered it, gonna blame it on SGoYT!

	<body>My wallet officially hates you all.

I went for the Prima version (shiny metal coins!!!!!) and the base game too (otherwise this would be pretty useless).

[user=bilboatbagend][/user] wouldn&apos;t stop banging on about it and this led me to investigate it further.  

After reading Morten&apos;s blog about how he developed the Automa system and then watching some playthroughs of it, I was won over.

The fact it plays pretty quickly and has a campaign system too are just more reasons to get it.

A special shout out also goes to [user=juanma99][/user] who way back in November posted something on SGoYT that initially sparked my interest.

It was expensive but if I just sell the rest of my collection I will be fine. :D </body>

	<body>Those who saw my thread ([thread=1313460][/thread]) about a month ago may recall my frustration at picking this up when I was on a trip in Austin.

The Onimeeple was smudged, a couple cards were bent and the nightmare cards were WAY off size from the rest of the deck.

Fastforward to today when I took my daughter out to give my wife some much needed alone time. I was browsing the FLGS and saw this sitting there. Initially I dismissed it. I had the bad experience earlier this month and this was always a game I was back and forth on anyway. Might as well pass.

But then, for reasons unknown, I picked it up. I looked at the back.

&quot;14.99&quot;

Wait... I thought MSRP was 24.99. It was. That&apos;s what I paid in Austin. They must not have updated their price for this with the second edition.

So yeah... I had to. Got it home and opened it.

No smudge.

Cards appear to be uniform, though the nightmare cards still seem to be a HAIR bigger, but that might be my imagination.
[b]Edit:[/b] Turns out 4 of the 10 nightmare cards a bit bigger, but it doesn&apos;t seem to be as drastic as in my other box. I think that it will be fine to play seeing as the deck will rarely be perfectly flush, but I may email Z-Man just to see if they&apos;d send me replacements.

And as far as I can tell, no creases, though I didn&apos;t unwrap the other deck yet.

Victory... probably.</body>

	<body>There were a couple of games SGoYT made me buy, but this one stands out, as it has seen lots of play and also was relatively expensive (I think Onirim, Freitag and Space Hulk Death Angel together don&apos;t amount to the same price)... 

There&apos;s no one user in particular that made me buy it, it was more or less the frequency with which it kept getting mentioned here.

In any case, I was surprised how much I enjoy solo gaming. Thanks guys!</body>

	<body>SGOYT made me buy the base game, so I blame it for the purchase of the expansion too!

Modular expansion with 11 modules that can be included individually or together, including: wind, crew loyalty, contraband, more special weapons, more ship upgrades, a gold carrying galleon NPC, NPC ship upgrades, more rumour/mission/captain cards, a new kind of ship, favors and location tokens.

Already loving the base game and this expansion gives a bunch more goodies to get excited about. </body>

	<body>This board has cost me a small fortune. Every time I look, which is often, someone is playing something that I haven&apos;t seen before. My birthday is coming up in May so I&apos;ve bought myself some gifts. 

Space Empires has been getting a lot of love recently and it&apos;s something I&apos;ve had my eye on for a while but always ended up getting something else instead. When I finally want to buy it, it felt like I had to hunt down the only available copy in the UK still in stock. Looking forward to having a go at this. 

I&apos;ve also had my eye on [thing=140620][/thing] so got that on order as well. Looks like something slightly different (and shorter) than a lot of the other games I&apos;ve got. 

Luckily I have run out of space in the cupboard, and also things that are taking my fancy so my purchases will hopefully be limited to buying new releases such as the new Mage Knight expansion when that comes out. Otherwise some stuff needs to sell on the marketplace. </body>

	<body>After a spree of buying very &quot;thinky&quot; games, a post by [user=joestin][/user] led me to reading and watching some videos on this. Finally picked it up yesterday.

I was looking for something that was more of an &quot;along for the ride&quot; experience for those nights were I am too burned out after work to do much thinking. I have fond memories of this game from back when the original edition came out in the mid-1980s. This was a boisterous lunch time game for a bunch of us in high school. We alternated between this and [thing=2795][/thing].

I have a soft spot for this game, it&apos;s like a fantasy-themed slapstick routine.</body>

	<body>My sister and her family sent me an Amazon gift card with instructions to put it towards a new game (how could I say no to that?). I was very close to picking up Cruel Necessity last night but I had recently received a copy of Ottoman Sunset from my Secret Soloist and my parents gave me Hapsburg Eclipse for my birthday so ultimately I decided that since I have two SoS games that are new to me adding a third might be overkill and I ended up using the gift card towards the purchase of Enemy Coast Ahead instead. I had about $18 in rewards on my account so ECA only cost me about $2.90! :D

It should be arriving on Monday so I expect to get this on the May SGOYT list.</body>

	<body>Back in Feb. I ended up preordering two games from the GMT P500.  The first one that made its way to my cart was Liberty or Death, I was very much interested in the COIN series after seeing so many posts about Fire in the Lake, A Distant Plain, etc. and was actually on GMTs site to pick up something different (see below). While I was browsing I decided to check out the COIN games and saw this one had been added.  Fresh off the first season of TURN on AMC my interest in the Revolutionary War was piqued and I have no other games that model this conflict so I decided to pick it up after reading some blog posts and early play test reports.  I expect I will enjoy this and I&apos;m looking forward to it!

The real reason I was over at GMTs site though was to get an order in for Silent Victory.  I had read some posts about the Hunters and that led me to reading about the upcoming SV game which uses the same mechanics.  One thing that kind of held me back from picking up The Hunters was that I already had a game about the German&apos;s WWII sub campaign (U-Boat Leader) and wasn&apos;t really too interested in another.  I was also a little disappointed that FC:Nimitz did not offer much depth on the US Sub campaign in the Pacific and so Silent Victory was hitting all the right notes for me.

After a generous windfall from my Secret Soloist and my birthday this month I currently have 5 new solo games in hand (well 4 + an expansion) to play so I&apos;m sort of glad I have to wait for these to come in.</body>

	<body>Well, I&apos;d been waffling on this game and put it in the &quot;maybe one day&quot; category but then I happened to come across someone selling this one, 

[thing=157002][/thing], 
[imageid=1978442]

and [thing=26306][/thing] 
[imageid=1824556]

... for less than $70 for all three with shipping included. Boxed editions. I jumped on it. 

The main attraction here is the one pictured, for sure, though the ACW seems interesting. Not much of a Vietnam guy as far as theme. I plan to play all three at some point and then sell any I don&apos;t particularly love to recoup some of the cost. Have a friend who&apos;s very much interested in Vietnam War era games, so first I&apos;ll lend that one to him. 

I won&apos;t get to DTOM for a while as I&apos;m currently obsessed with [thing=67600][/thing], but I&apos;m curious to try it out and see if it&apos;s as interesting as some claim it to be.

	<body>I&apos;m not trying to buy games -- I&apos;m really not!

I didn&apos;t actually buy this. I had [thing=1927][/thing] on my Trade List for a while (thought it would be good with the kids) and got a new in shrink in a math trade just before Thanksgiving. I was in the Thrifty Santa exchange -- and got a normal (not Deluxe) and open copy of Munchkin. Then, for Christmas, my wife&apos;s mother got all her grandkids games. And what did my 11 yr old daughter get? Munchkin Deluxe, new in shrink. So many Munchkins!

I played one with my daughter and decided to trade the other NIS Deluxe copy. But Munchkin is a game that some people love and just as many hate.  I put it up on a few Math Trades and nothing. Then, after the most recent one, someone offered my NIS copy for [thing=71721][/thing]. I put this on my Wish List because it looked interesting from the SGoYT list. It&apos;s not the kind of game I would usually go for but the replayability and the scifi theme looked cool (and I&apos;m not always into theme). So I traded -- and I can&apos;t wait for it to get to the table!

	<body>The first of three recent purchases as part of my birthday blowout.

[user=reverendunclebastard][/user] strikes again!

I have been eying this game for about a year but it&apos;s lack of solo rules has kept me away.

The he goes and creates a pretty simple solo variant for it that doesn&apos;t require much upkeep and delivers a pretty normal experience for the person playing the condemned.

I&apos;ve been wanting a quick set up and play dungeon crawler since I got rid of the D&amp;D games.  This seems to deliver what I want when I don&apos;t have time to set up Gears of War.

I had to pull the trigger.</body>

	<body>Another one I have been circling for a while.

I have enjoyed ATOE and COPE by Flying Frog Productions and after watching some playthroughs I became interested.

Positive words from [user=kerskine][/user]
and some great posts and pictures by [user=Zouave][/user] pushed me over the edge.

I&apos;m starting to think I have a problem.</body>

	<body>I have wanted this game for well over a year but the price of getting a copy had prevented it.  It had become my &apos;grail&apos; game.

Then [user=repairmanjack][/user] decided to use April SGOYT as his own personal report on it and the sequel to it.

Then [thing=176524][/thing] went live on Kickstarter.

I decided to back it heavily but didn&apos;t really have the money, even with some birthday cash coming my way.

Then another SGOYTer (if they want to reveal themselves they can) got in touch just after my birthday to offer me this and Rise of Rome (plus KS extras, etc) for a decent price.  I couldn&apos;t say no.

They arrived today.

[imageid=2516227]Aren&apos;t they gorgeous.

Anyway, I&apos;m still backing Origins, although at a lower level and I can start playing Hoplo today (well maybe Sunday as I have non-gaming friends arriving today).

That&apos;s three exciting (and large boxed) purchases which I have no way to store in my house. Poop!

I really do have a problem.... :shake:</body>

	<body>I&apos;ve been looking to get this one for some time (since I first saw it on SGoYT). It has always been out of stock or too expensive for my budget. That was until Friday when a 3rd party seller on Amazon dropped the price to about the lowest it has ever been (including delivery). I had to order it there and then. It should arrive Thursday but, unfortunately, I do not have any free evenings or weekends for the next 6 weeks.</body>

	<body>Woo!  After reading practically EVERYONE&apos;S rave reviews about this for solo play, I finally got it!  My friend got my Tokaido for my birthday, but I backed the CE on kickstarter.  So difficult not to tear into the regular edition due to my CE not being here... still.  
GOW hasn&apos;t arrived yet, (epic fail for FedEx... was supposed to be here Friday according to Amazon, gonna be here Tuesday says FedEx... they&apos;re ALWAYS late), but man am I excited!  Rulebook reading is scheduled for tomorrow so I can get playing ASAP on Tuesday!

and follow up comment of approval by [user=schiavonir][/user]
made me do some research on it.  A lot of people seemed to use this game as the counterpoint to people who had nothing but bad things to say about Kickstarter games.  And as it turned out, the publisher was running a Kickstarter for an expansion right then, with the base game as a reasonably priced add-on.  So I jumped in!  Expect to see this on SGoYT in the future!</body>

	<body>This is a funny one....

Star Realms has been on my radar since it came out. But, if you remember, they started with a small print run so in the beginning this game went for a lot of money. I decided to wait until time goes down, and then I got distracted with other games.

The app came out, though, and I liked it. So I started thinking about the real thing. And then I started in this guild and the monthly challenges that [user=ShaunGamer][/user] issues. And then it got lots of praise and won in the 2014 contest. But my time for solo gaming has diminished of late.

Sigh.

So I found myself with some Amazon credits (more than enough for this game) and I thought and debated. I have a friend and fellow gamer at work with me. He&apos;s a &quot;social&quot; lunch person and I, frankly, am not. Instead of idle chit-chat we&apos;ve played a couple of games. He and I worked on a work-from-home schedule once a week. I think after I confirmed that he will be actually working from home I turned around and purchased this. 

I blame the whole Guild for this, but especially ShaunGamer.</body>

I can&apos;t quite explain how this game went from &quot;not interested&quot; to &quot;must have&quot; literally within the course of a weekish, but it did. I&apos;ve been interested in Marvel for awhile, but with so many people saying Dark City was all but necessary for a challenging solo game, the price of getting base game and expansion held me at bay.

I&apos;ve never seen Aliens. Don&apos;t care to. But I kept finding myself clicking over to the game page for this one. One review here. One review there. A picture here. A picture there.

And after recalling the endorsements of Rev, Jason (he who called it a &quot;masterpiece&quot;), Shaun, and a slew of others, the itch to get this and see what the fuss about simply snowballed.

Today, a perfect storm of discovering 20 bucks I didn&apos;t realize I had, a 15% off coupon for B&amp;N and a need to take my daughter out of the house so my wife could work came together. I... can... not... wait.</body>

Thankful to the publisher for lots of zip-lok bags as pre-play was sorting player setup bags to alleviate the solo-ease-of-setup (or lack of) which appears in a few of the  SGOYT Entries.

Only 1 play so far but, for me, when this hits the table it will need to stay out for a several plays to stand any chance of making headway into the hand selection against building offer puzzle.</body>

Just purchased it today from Amazon - making sure I picked an OLGS as the seller.  I do that whenever I purchase a game from Amazon.com because I like to support my FLGS, and if I&apos;m not buying from them, I make sure someone else (besides a large corporation) makes the sale, if at all possible.

Friday arrives on Monday and Monday is my Friday.  I think that&apos;s a sign.</body>

	<body>I could type out an explanation of how I went to my FLGS planning to grab Friday for my buddy for his birthday (seeing if I can get ANY of my buddies into some solo games). I could tell you about how they didn&apos;t have a copy of Friday so I grabbed this instead. I could tell you that I don&apos;t think my buddy would be into this given the kind of oddball art/theme/etc., but that he WOULD appreciate the easy-to-grasp theme of Friday, so I could just give him my copy of Friday.

I could tell you all of those things.

	<body>I bought this and the base game thanks to all the posts over the last couple of months that have said how this is a different game with this expansion and how much better it is.

Elder Sign was one of my first purchases when I got back in to gaming in 2013 but I got rid of it last year as the base game is merely OK and can take a long time to set up and play for what it is.

I have renewed love of dice games (Nations Dice Game, Pandemic The Cure, Vivajava Dice Game, etc) so have decided to give it another go now that it is different.

I have only &apos;gone back&apos; to one previously owned game before and that didn&apos;t go well.  Fingers crossed this goes better.</body>

I have not, though I&apos;ve heard that it&apos;s supposed to be good.[/q]

It is.  I picked it up this year after watching Ricky Royals video and find it very fascinating.  Essentially your species evolves and depending on the genetic path you take it unlocks specific enhancements that allows you to survive in specific environments.  You can also pass along some of the genes to another species when you bring them into play.  Definitely worth a look if that&apos;s your field of interest.[/q]

That was enough to get me to watch the videos, and from there it didn&apos;t take me long to decide to purchase a copy. It just arrived today. I see dinosaurs in my future...</body>

	<body>I blame this one on:

[user=tekawiz][/user]

His posts about [thing=56641][/thing], containing beautiful photos of his minis and terrain led me to looking into the Twohourwargames systems. The idea of a solo miniatures skirmish game was just too hard to resist. Originally I was looking at the version with pirates, but after some research I decided I wanted to go with the old west ruleset. I love the cowboy theme, and given the large amount of prepainted buildings available from 4ground (for the Dead Man&apos;s Hand game) it was kind of a no-brainer.

Hit my local (awesome) FLGS, which carries the Twohourwargames rules (and lots of mini/terrain supplies) and bought the rules plus these pre-painted minis:

[imageid=2579459 large]

[imageid=2579460 large]

And some starter terrain (made by 4ground and Bandau):

[imageid=2579461 large]

[imageid=2579462 large]

[imageid=2579463 large]

[imageid=2579465 large]

I need to get through a few plays of [thing=67600][/thing] and then I am going to set up and play a few small skirmishes to familiarize myself with the [thing=30834][/thing] rules. Then on to a campaign!</body>

So far, no games purged and I just bought this last night.  A good secondhand copy appeared on eBay and I couldn&apos;t resist.

Responsibility sits squarely on the shoulders of 

[user=davekuhns][/user]
I had watched a playthrough of the solo game by 

[user=joystickz][/user]
a while back and it looked pretty good.

However, it was Dave&apos;s continuous playing of it and then feeling the need to talk about it on SGOYT that pushed me over the edge.

I hope you are happy Dave. ;)

I&apos;ve watched so many videos and read so many positive solo reports on this game, but it just looked sooooo dry. Regardless, I finally caved and after my initial play I&apos;m glad I did. Don&apos;t really care for the theme but it&apos;s a great brain-burner (for me at least) that plays super quick for as puzzley as it is. Love it so far.

I&apos;m slightly ashamed to admit that I haven&apos;t played this yet, but it&apos;s on my list to play soon dammit and I will...I will. :shake:

Prior to SGOYT, I was a little turned off to this game after reading about how incomprehensible the rules were, but after reading several posts on SGOYT about how thematic and fun the game can be once you get past those abhorrent rules, I just had to try it out. I should clarify that I didn&apos;t actually purchase this one; it was acquired in a trade.</body>

	<body>On the next shelf down from Level 7 Escape sits this beauty. Unlike Level 7, I have actually played this one a few times and I can say that I have found it to live up to the praise it receives on SGOYT. It&apos;s thematic, tense, great-looking, fun and DIFFICULT! After reading several posts about it on SGOYT, it turned up in Fantasy Flight&apos;s Holiday Sale last year and  was able to pick up a copy for $30. It would have been well worth it at twice that price.

GoW is a game that I plan to explore significantly more over the next 6-12 months as I have only attempted the first two missions. I even managed to get my hands on a mission pack before they became so exceedingly rare.</body>

I just picked this up last week from a Geeklist auction so I haven&apos;t had a chance to play yet, but it&apos;s on the docket for sometime this week. Besides SGOYT, the other reason that I decided to get this game was this it&apos;s by NSKN Games. I backed their Mistfall Kickstarter a few months ago and it&apos;s set to deliver early. Yes, you heard that right, I said early :surprise: :thumbsup: They ran an outstanding Kickstarter project, were very responsive to questions and comments in the forum and genuinely seem like an awesome bunch of people. </body>

I bought this back in November after reading so many glowing posts on SGOYT  and it still sits mocking me from its shelf still nattily dressed in its original shrink :blush:

I already owned Hornet Leader that I picked up in a trade earlier in the year and really liked the game play. The consensus seemed to mostly be that TAL is even better than HL so it was a must-buy for me. It might not be until later in August or sometime in September, but I will cracking into all that lovely cardboard soon.</body>

A friend of mine backed the Tiny Epic Galaxies KS and I went in with him for a copy of TEG and also got Tiny Epic Kingdoms. I wasn&apos;t originally planning to get TED (do I really need three Tiny Epic games?) until I saw all the posts about solitaire play on SGOYT. I have played it twice so far; once solitaire and once with my wife. It is entertaining, fairly simple and plays quickly, but I worry that it may get repetitive after a large number of plays. Not sure if this will stay in my collection long-term, but its case is helped by the minuscule amount of shelf space it requires. So there&apos;s that.</body>

	<body>It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve added anything to this list.  I&apos;ve purchased many games seen on the SGOYT but usually it was a sale or great used price that really influenced the purchase.  SGOYT mostly just put it on my radar.  Space Empires 4X is the exception.  Initially seeing pictures and reports of this game was a complete turn off as it looked way too complicated for my tastes.  I couldn&apos;t even get myself to read about your sessions.  That was too overwhelming.  But you guys just wouldn&apos;t stop and finally I decided to look into it further.  This game jumped from my &quot;not interested&quot; list to &quot;must have&quot; within a day.  Then I saw it on Craigslist.  But the price was $50!!!  For a used copy at that. :gulp:  Sorry not interested....yes you are :D  It was punched, played once, and like new condition.  SOLD.

Thanks SGOYT</body>

	<body>Let me start this post by saying that I&apos;m way overdue on posting here. I started reading SGOYT sometime in the latter half of 2014 (October maybe?). Since that time, I count no fewer than 14 games I have purchased or received in trades as a direct result of reading entries on SGOYT. Yes, that&apos;s right, you&apos;re all to blame :devil:

I am going to start working through those 14 games I purchased in the order that they sit on my game shelf. Tonight&apos;s selection: Alien Uprising. I got this in a trade after reading about it several times on SGOYT. The theme is right in my wheelhouse and it sounds fun and difficult. Unfortunately, Alien Uprising has the dubious distinction of being among the half dozen or so SGOYT made me buy this games that have yet to see play time. Soon...soon. So many games, so little time :soblue:</body>

This game only partially belongs on this list. I have been interested in RC since last summer, but would not have taken the plunge and bought it without reading the posts on SGOYT. It was reading about how thematic, fun and brutal the game play could be on all those SGOYT entries that pushed me over the edge. This is another that I have yet to play. I got so far as setting it up and reading the rules, but then had to clear it off the game table for some reason. :modest:</body>

This is the kind of game that I may have avoided prior to SGOYT. It doesn&apos;t have much theme and is the type of game that I can appreciate for it sleekness and design, but don&apos;t often have the desire to play. After reading about it time and again on SGOYT though, my curiosity was piqued and I had to see what all the fuss was about. I have played the game once solitaire and quite enjoyed it. I also want to introduce it to my wife and possibly my gaming group.</body>

	<body>Bought this from Amazon, about an hour ago. It was very close between this and Fields of Arle (but I want to solo La Granja a bit, before getting something that might be too similar).

You can round up the usual suspects and blame them for this one. (You know who you are...)

And, whilst making up that order, I finally went in for Star Realms (and the Gambit set) and the first Imperial Settlers expansion.

Gates of Loyang priced itself out of the running very quickly. Looked like shortage-prices, which I try not to endorse on general principal.

Almost pre-ordered the new Eldritch Horror expansion, but their BS &quot;two to four week delivery&quot; line, fooled me once before. Although it&apos;s out every-bloody-where but the UK, it seems.</body>

	<body>I played a lot of hex and counter wargames in my teens and early twenties (also known as a long time ago). I have [thing=67600][/thing] which is a great solo wargame and has been a wonderful addition to my collection. However, there are so many great wargames that I would love to play. I have never been into playing both sides, but seeing so many great write-ups from SGOYT participants who are doing just that, I figured I needed to give it another try. If I can learn to enjoy it, it would open up so many options for me. I did some digging looking for a tactical hex and counter game that met the following conditions:

1 - Medium to excellent suitability for solitaire play
2 - Fairly light ruleset (for a wargame anyway)
3 - lots of replayability in the box
4 - Expandable system in case I get hooked

This game with its excellent solitaire suitability, 8 maps, 75 scenarios, 825 counters and myriad expansions and big box sets available was the most appealing. Counters punched, rules read, just need to clip the counters and I am ready to give it a try.

There is a lot of blame to pass around, but I will blame [user=Zouave][/user] for reminding me recently about the solitaire suitability of so many wargames, and [user=de_la_poer][/user] for his recent postings about [thing=12459][/thing].

	<body>Way behind the curve on this, which is odd given how many plays I&apos;ve made of Onirim and Urbion. I&apos;d made plenty of noise about this being a day one pick up and, being contrary, the thing that had stalled me was the size of the box. I guess we&apos;ve outgrown the earlier small packages of its predecessors, but shelf space is getting a tad tighter than I&apos;d like. I may even have to ditch it and put the cards in with another game - as much as it pains me. 

I&apos;m also not a massive fan of tower defense style games, but the art style and the deck management angle of this have convinced me. Plus, the designer just hasn&apos;t let me down yet. 

Draw a card when you lose a fountain, right?

Any word on the availability on the listed expansion/promo deck?</body>

	<body>As the new Kickstarter already has twice its funding goal I think it is fair to say I will be paying for this in a weeks time.

This game has appeared a reasonable number of times on SGoYT recently. It looks like a game I will really enjoy but I could not find it in stock anywhere. Thankfully the second printing has gone to Kickstarter and reached its goal in a few hours.</body>

	<body>After continually telling myself  again and again, I will not get into any game that is collectible ...
 
And definitely not this new really cool looking Dungeon &amp; Dragons version of Dice Masters that keeps appearing on SGoYT ...

That has this really great solo variant that means I get to play the game even when no-one else wants to play!

Unfortunately, a bunch of you broke down my resolve when I innocently asked some simple questions in the 1 Player Guild. 


I received the starter today along with a[BGCOLOR=#FF00FF] [b][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Minsc and Boo [/COLOR][/b][/BGCOLOR] Promo Card.
It didn&apos;t help that a fellow BGG 1 Player Guild member sent me some great cards that he didn&apos;t want. So now I have a good start on a collection.:(
I am LOST. :cry:

Plans are already in progress for how I am going to obtain more cards and dice. :shake:</body>

	<body>Missing out of the fun with real solo scenario cards. Was getting jealous of the solo write-ups on SGoYT. 

Saw a Gambit Set pack on UK Amazon at a realistic price (below £10) and saw that classic Captain Scarlet DVD box set was reduced too. So had both with free postage . . . no contest!

The app version of the cards look slightly different from card version so that threw me until I actually read what the cards said.

And its not that I had my eye on this one for many reasons. The adjustable player count that lets one player leave the game if he has to, The fact that it can be played with 7 players and that I always wanted a tower defence game like tis.

I nearly backed it on kickstarter but didn&apos;t can&apos;t remember why at the moment, probably because of reasons. But now its mine and I hope to be able to play it this weekend, won&apos;t have enough time to read the rules before that.

I am excited to get this to the table, and my girlfriend is even more excited that there are two competitive scenarios (playing as the predators). She loves beating me at board games, and she is good at it. :gulp:

	<body>And the trifecta is complete. I enjoy Agricola and think Le Havre is just amazing, so this seemed like a logical progression for the collection. Problem is, it&apos;s been hard to get hold of, for a long time, in the UK, unless you wanted to pay upwards of £65-75 - and that&apos;s from regular stores, never mind the &quot;scalpers&quot;. 

Looks like a hefty reprint just came out, as it&apos;s available in a good few places, and for cheaper than previous RRP. It isn&apos;t going to be this price for long - and I&apos;ve been watching it sell out, over this weekend, so decided it was time to grab it. Not that I need a new game, or have space, but... well, a good price means I&apos;m saving money by buying it, right?

	<body>To be honest, I can blame SGoYT and the 1 Player Guild for most games in my collection, to the point that every month I add new ones to the pile of games that I haven&apos;t played yet. I made the resolution to learn a new one every weekend, so I started with this one.

At first I was on the fence with SotM because of the art: it looked too amateur for me, the kind of things that your friend from high-school used to do. But when I started playing it I noticed the cleverness of the design , I loved that every hero has a different font and design and every villain and enviroment has a different back. In the end, I&apos;m REALLY digging the cartoony style. You can tell that a lot of love has been put into this game.

And the gameplay is awesome. With three heroes it&apos;s a challenge but there isn&apos;t too much bookkeeping (I&apos;m using the app, which could be better handling effects and bonuses, but it&apos;s fine).

To sum up: I&apos;m having a blast. 
Thank you, SGoYT!</body>

I also got the mission 1 expansion.

I bought also Space Hulk (4th ed.) just to play solo (and when my wife feels like kickin&apos; my butt), but solo mainly.</body>

	<body>I have wanted this one for a while, but it hasn&apos;t been available locally so I have managed to avoid it, until now.

The recent post by [user=ValDoonican][/user]

put it back on my radar, and a friend was putting in an online order and asked if I wanted to piggy-back on the order. So I did it! Looking forward to this arriving, hope I can get a few plays in before [user=moe45673]Moe[/user] makes me lend it to him and then never gives it back!

Of course I couldn&apos;t limit myself to just the one game in the order, so I also added [thing=148601][/thing], an amazing looking supply-line/racing/war game that plays 1-3 with asymmetrical player set-ups. Haven&apos;t really seen it posted about around here so I can only really blame myself for that one!</body>

	<body>There are so many people who are responsible for making me want this game but it has always seemed to expensive for what you get so I&apos;ve not bothered making they jump. That was until [user=warerare][/user] told me the designer was at an event with some copies for sale. I was unable to attend but asked him to get me a copy if he was getting one.

Unfortunately there was not enough copies left for me to have one but I was excited to get one so I had to go out and find a shop selling it. Luckily I found a Danish store selling an English copy for £12 less than Amazon or any other UK game store. I now have another game to add to my collection of unplayed games.</body>

	<body>So Target was having a sale last week on board games: buy 2 get the 3rd free.  How could I pass that up?

I saw they had this as one of their games, but it was currently out of stock.  :cry:  I walked away from the computer for a few hours with the page for this game up on Target&apos;s website.  When I came back, I hit F5 on a  whim and much to my amazement the &quot;Add to Cart&quot; button lit up when the page reloaded and I jumped a little on the inside.  :cool:  And so it was that I had found my 2nd game of two.  I was also looking at [thing=183562][/thing] and [thing=129437][/thing] but I wasn&apos;t sure on the solo play of the former, and I think I&apos;ve decided not to get the latter.  So nice Target decided to restock L&amp;C for me.  :)

I blame this on 

[user=moe45673][/user] [user=davekuhns][/user] [user=ibbo][/user]

and anyone else that posted about it on SGOYT.  :)</body>

I was looking for a decent deck builder after recently picking up [thing=174570][/thing], loved the game play, but don&apos;t really like the theme.  Also the card art is unsuitable for small children which means I&apos;d have to hide the game away.  Does anyone in the UK fancy trading some Thunderstone for Predator?</body>

	<body>Frustrated by waiting for my Thunderbirds game to arrive and weakened by the frequent name dropping I came home with a copy.

Both are now at home and I still haven&apos;t been able to try them out this weekend has been a wipe out.

Friday - out all day at the wife&apos;s Gynae appointment and a visit to my favourite city game shops. Crashed out on the bed and slept through until the morning.

Saturday - out all day doing Saturday stuff then off shopping and filling up the freezer with meat and other foods for next few weeks/months. Then off setting up a TV box for an elder couple and then tried to sort out their android tablets (they need a new one as their &apos;new&apos; one was rooted and was badly faulting), cooked dinner and crashed out again.

Sunday - started well but I rapidly lost control of the day, took a different elderly friend to hospital to see wife who had been rushed in during the night having suffered a suspected heart attack (turned out to be some kind arrhythmia and after a change of meds has been sent home). Got home and my daughter had left the freezer (which I had just filled up on Friday) door a jar and may have burned out the frost free unit electronics (only had the thing for 5 months) so spent the rest of the evening racing around the town filling friends&apos; freezers up with anything that was still frozen.

Too tired and cheesed off to even look in either box now. I think I&apos;ll find a corner and rock back and forth quietly. :cry:</body>

	<body>I held off as long as I could.  It was not easy.  It seemed every time the funds were available and I was ready to pull the trigger it was out of stock.  Once the super deluxe edition was available at a good price I bit.  I&apos;m very happy to get this and have plenty of time to play before voting on the 2015 top 100 solo games.

Who&apos;s to blame for this purchase?  Well it was a collective effort.  But it was [thread=1454478]THIS THREAD[/thread] that provided the final push.  Hence I place the blame on:

I went from &quot;this looks neat&quot; to purchasing the game and expansion in about 15 minutes. As good as I&apos;ve been about impulse purchases this year this Space Race era game really grabbed me. 

I&apos;m anxiously awaiting fulfillment of my order (which is apparently quite slow from this shop). I&apos;ve even already read the rule book.

[b]Update 10/30[/b]: It has arrived! As much as I want to dig into it now I&apos;m all booked up for the night so I have to wait until tomorrow...

	<body>In a very out of character move (akin to an out of body experience, but one must pun board games when possible) I bought [thing=25292][/thing] at a LGS today, for full retail price.

It&apos;s been years since I&apos;ve been to a LGS and I recall buying something each time I walked in, so perhaps it&apos;s not so out of character considering that. Why must I feel like I should spend money when I walk into a LGS?

This purchase was the result of people frequently posting positively about  [user=Woelf]Woelf&apos;s[/user] solitaire variant on SGoYT. And to be honest, I know nothing about the game or the variant, so the purchase was based on the reputations of you fine soloists out there.

	<body>I&apos;ve been resisting buying this for well over a year. &quot;It&apos;s too complicated to learn,&quot; I&apos;d tell myself. &quot;It takes too long, when will you have that much free time?&quot; I&apos;d ask.

Then Target had a sale. I contemplated picking up a cheap copy of Pandemic or 7 Wonders as a Christmas present for the neighbors...but if they have their own copy, they might start playing [i]without me[/i]. I have few enough opportunities for game nights, I can&apos;t go letting them cut their reliance on my collection... :whistle:

That left Mage Knight. The time issue hasn&apos;t gone away, but I&apos;ve been seriously considering the possibility of dropping my cable service to save money. Less TV = more game time. It could happen. 

In any case, the New Game Smell is strong with this one...</body>

	<body>I&apos;ve been looking at this for quite a while. It&apos;s been on my Amazon Wishlist just sitting there taunting me. In addition, all the while there were constant posts on the 1-Player Guild about how great a game it is.

As noted in the previous Mage Knight post above, last week&apos;s Target sale was just too much to pass up. I pulled the trigger, and just got it a few days ago.

I&apos;ve been spending my time watching the videos and reading the rules and Walkthrough guide. Really looking forward to getting this to the table as soon as possible!

[b]Okay now, who to blame? [/b] Well, let&apos;s just say all y&apos;all, because that pretty much is what it feels like. I know there are a few detractors out here, but I&apos;ve been able to bypass those reports.

Honestly it&apos;s not blame...I&apos;m thankful for the recommendation!

So when someone offered a lot of Mage Knight, the Lost Legion expansion and Krang in one lot? That Mage Knight game people over here at SGoYT just seem to adore so much? I made a bid. And won :)

I told myself that £55 was still too much money for a board game. Especially one you rip apart while playing it. But Chaos Cards has it for £45 at the moment and I couldn&apos;t turn down the chance to buy it for that price.</body>

	<body>I&apos;ve been interested in this game since I first saw it on SGoYT but there has always been a reason not to buy it. It was going for a good price while I was looking at Pandemic Legacy so I decided to add it to the order. I guess I will blame [user=ibbo][/user] and [user=davekuhns][/user] as they have both played it this month.</body>

	<body>I think this one is exclusively thanks to [user=Patton55][/user] especially when he started drawing parallels to the games of Phil Eklund. I&apos;m a sucker for an unusual theme, and this really seems both out there and grounded in a tight economic design. 

Placed my order today for it to be made, and the projected despatch date is 16th December. Unlikely to see it before Christmas, but I should have a game or two to play in the mean time. 

Good job I recently had a little bonus, as I&apos;m going to be sitting on a ring-cushion for the rest of the week after deciding to stump up for the international postage charge. Ouch. </body>

	<body>I... I can&apos;t even look at myself in the mirror right now. Comfortably the most I&apos;ve ever &quot;invested&quot; in a game. I think I was all over once the first posts came in. (You know who you are, people.) I&apos;m overlooking the miniature construction, which will be fairly painstaking, but everything I&apos;ve read about this game convinces me it&apos;s absolutely what I&apos;ve been waiting for in the hobby. 

The Black Friday discount was enough to offset the postage to the UK. It&apos;s been in and out of my shopping basket all day... Hand on heart, at least I can say it wasn&apos;t an impulse buy (although I feel slightly hollow that I&apos;m posting two entries here, back to back). 

Very excited at seeing this on the table. </body>

	<body>The art of the Oniverse has appealed since I first saw it in SGOYT.  However the game-play &amp; write-ups of #1-3 kept them out of my collection.  #4 being tiles, not cards increased the appeal &amp; Moes posts in SGOYT tipped the scales.

Box arrived today - shrink is off, tiles are punched out... tried putting them in the insert slots, but either there are too many for the slots, or I need to change the tile orientation.  

Either way I think the insert and double flap are eye-candy for open box displays when selling at conventions, but have short term appeal for me. Card box(es) &amp; dice/tile bag(s) may be a future storage solution.

Still have 2015 challenges to complete, so this will have the same fate as other 2015 purchases; quick first play, then pause for 2016 Challenges.

But then [user=Valenso]Kevin M[/user] had to mention it was the daily sale at MM for $33.

	<body>I&apos;ve been reading about this game and became increasingly curious about it. Sounds like it&apos;s crazy hard, at least at first, but there&apos;s a breakthrough to be achieved in how to play well. I&apos;m a fan of intricate card play such as 1PG favorite, [b]Mage Knight[/b], so this tripped my wires. It sounds like it has a faster setup and overhead than MK too, though I won&apos;t be surprised if that turns out not to be true. 

From what I&apos;m reading, the game seems to a fast growing base of fans who appreciate the angle of this deckbuilder and the challenge provided. It became a game I simply must try for myself. I have a monthly coop group who might like this as an occasional challenge as well so it could see double duty.

Then I saw an auction for the game as well as:

[imageid=2089303]

AND

[imageid=2302069]

So I put in the minimum bid. And was surprised to find I was the only bidder on it. For all that I got, it was a great price.

From what other research I&apos;ve done, it sounds like this 

[imageid=2691808]

is a must-have to round the game out, so I&apos;m adding it to my pending CSI order. Sounds like it refines the game in some good ways, especially with dual-color attacks. 

The biggest culprits in convincing me to look at this game that was otherwise nowhere near my radar are:

	<body>I heard of this one through 1PG so it was sort of on my radar, and then I watched a Ricky Royal video of it.

And then the Canadian dollar tanked.

And then people started talking about it with the People&apos;s Choice 100.

And then I saw a copy for the equivalent of $20 USD, sitting new at a game store... Mound Builders is now $37 USD on the VPG website, and there is the whole shipping question from the states!

So I caved.  That was yesterday.

This morning I woke up and saw an email about a game in my inbox and I thought &quot;What?  I don&apos;t need any games.&quot;

So the whirlwind may be over.

Sorry folks.  Hope you enjoyed the ride.

	<body>Dice had a point there. I need to add two new games to this list.

When my Blood Bath pledge for Hoplomachus: Origins was apparently lost during shipping (as it looks now), I went a bit crazy and bought this. Will probably arrive next year, but looking forward to playing this. I hope its good, shipping to germany alone is more than another new game would cost me. Was stupid to buy it, but I needed something to cheer me up at that point :)</body>

I think it was [user=Joestin] who made some comparison to LoR:LCG without the deck building. That sold it for me. I hated building my own decks.  LoR:LCG is brilliant, but I hate the deck building aspect of it. Now to see if this one holds up.</body>

Played one game so far and every time I got someone knocked out and finally  ended up losing, I knew what else I could have done differently. Their special abilities offer some great combinations (that I need to use more).

	<body>Continuing the [user=Bilboatbagend][/user] blame game I thought I&apos;d mention this one.

Technically it was a trade but it&apos;s a new in shrink copy and I wouldn&apos;t have gone for it if it hadn&apos;t been for Ava&apos;s post about it. It also made me go and watch a playthrough.

She said it was more than just a fight fest and you went around doing different things.  That&apos;s why I like Merchants &amp; Maruaders and Fortune &amp; Glory.

It&apos;s not designed for solo play but doesn&apos;t seem like it will be hard to solo though and future expansions will probably add this anyway.

Fingers crossed its good.</body>

Sorry Kevin. I hate to call out one of my namesakes, but it has to be done :devil:

	<body>Ok so this particular game has not been mentioned on the SGoYT lists but bear with me.

There has been a lot of discussion about board games with minis, and even related discussions about painting said minis.

For some reason this spoke to a long buried mini gaming need inside me that has laid dormant for years now, back before I played wargames and even before I played Warhammer and Warhammer 40K I played WWII minis games.  Usually 1/72 scale.

Flash forward to now!
I&apos;ve been aware of this system, old Warhammer designers tackling WWII tactical wargame.  Colour me interested, though once I start painting it&apos;ll be colour me paint stained ...

So this one is on you guys, it really is, I take no responsibility for any of this. :shake:

Oh yeah I also bought [thing=53093][/thing], because I&apos;m weak.</body>

	<body>I was way behind the curve for Sylvion, which is odd considering how I&apos;ve always championed Onirim and, latterly, Urbion. I&apos;ve been playing Sylvion more and more of late, and I think it&apos;s really rising in the ranks for me. It was obviously just a matter of time before I got this, but I&apos;ve gone with my &quot;traditional&quot; &apos;It&apos;s Christmas&apos; excuse and I&apos;ll be having a crack at it over the holiday weekend.

Oh... yeah... Whilst putting in the order, I accidentally added [thing=150997][/thing] and [thing=178820][/thing], as I&apos;m really enamoured with the City of Ancients core set my family have already bestowed on me for Christmas.

I have mostly steered away from pirate-themed games after growing to loathe Pirates&apos; Cove a few years ago, but seeing entry after entry of this beautiful and engaging game eventually wore down my resistance. 

I put the game and the expansion on my Christmas list and received them as gifts. I have already played one solo game and am definitely glad that I gave in to this one :D</body>

	<body>So after many of you voted on [thread=1506684]what games I should add to my Kickstarter pledge[/thread] I had a good look at the video reviews from [user=SingleHandedWarfare][/user] and a few other random ones (Tom Vasel actually reviewed one of the games years ago). I looked at what games I wanted and decided it would be cheaper to buy DVG. Only joking. I ended up buying quite a few items and rather than list them all separately I thought I would combine them into this single post.

[thing=134520][/thing] - Kickstarter Item.
[thing=123955][/thing] - Recommended by over half of you.
[thing=65564][/thing] - Required to play the stretch goal.
[thing=129979][/thing] - Stretch Goal.
[thing=150010][/thing] - This one I wasn&apos;t so sure on due to the mixed reviews but as I was buying all the others I added it.
[thing=42673][/thing] - Highly recommended by everyone.
[thing=35350][/thing] - I&apos;ve seen this on SGoYT a few times and I had to add it if I was going to add the other Field Commander game.
[thing=149951][/thing] - The second highest recommended game and clearly a must own game.
[thing=169672][/thing] - Had to buy the UK pack.
[thing=169673][/thing] - Added this as apparently there are scenarios that require this pack.
[thing=169674][/thing] - Other than the next item this appeared to be the highest recommended add-on on the game page.
[thing=177753][/thing] - Seemed to include the best of the expansions I didn&apos;t buy plus a mounted board and additional rules.
[COLOR=#0033FF]DVG Deep Dish Counter Trays[/COLOR] - Bought a set of 5 to add to the games I end up playing the most.</body>

but also the post on this list by [user=Iz nibz][/user]

So SGOYT made me buy this and &apos;SGOYT made me buy this&apos; made me buy this. :D</body>

	<body>As I picked up [thing=137900][/thing] to take to the till I decided to check the sale items one more time.

My wife often jokes that I&apos;m like Rapids Johnson and lack great observation skills.

[youtube=4t-0kMzYWLw]

Well she&apos;s right. This was sitting in the sale items, with 50% off.  I had totally missed it the first time. :shake:

The regular appearances on SGOYT, the popularity of it in the top 100, [user=Maloma]Marty&apos;s[/user] challenges all made this hard to resist.

However, I&apos;m putting the majority of the blame on the shoulders of [user=Mo7189][/user]

4 of our top 5&apos;s were the same. The only difference was that we had picked a different euro. Mine was [thing=128621][/thing], his was this.

If he rates it that high I needed to give it a go.</body>

[user=repairmanjack][/user]

Especially with their posts in [listitem=3821715]April 2015[/listitem].

By the time I finally decided to pull the trigger before, I couldn&apos;t find it for a decent price anywhere. My main two online game stores that I buy from were sold out. But it recently appeared on the 1 Player Trade Post, so I finally acted.  Kickstarter Centimeeples too!! *Happy Dance*</body>

	<body>I went to one of my FLGS towards the end of last year as I wanted to pick up Neanderthal. They didn&apos;t have it in stock but suggested this game instead. I had seen it on SGoYT a few times and was interested but then I saw the price tag. £55 for the game with a RRP of £45. As I wasn&apos;t really after the game at that time I decided not to buy it. Then, 3 days later, [user=colmmccarthy][/user] posted the game on SGoYT and made me realise I should be looking into buying the game. I had set myself a goal of not buying anything until the UKGE in June so I wasn&apos;t looking very hard for a copy. Last week, as some of you may know :(, I badly failed my goal by going all in on a DVG Kickstarter with add-on games. With no goal holding me back, I took a walk to a different FLGS today just to see what they had in stock. They had the collectors edition there for £40 so I bought it.</body>

I successfully resisted the kickstarter campaign but broke down when I read the posts on SGOYT december. Watching the series didn&apos;t help my resolve...

So its about time I blame someone for buying this.

And I blame [user=reverendunclebastard] for the purchase of this really fun game.

After a few weeks trying to work out trades, I found most people were holding this tight.  I finally found someone local with this on their trade list and worked out a price.  The package included [thing=124839]TLC[/thing], [thing=139131]RoR[/thing] + KS exclusives, [thing=141412]Blade&apos;s Edge[/thing], [thing=141413]Legends of the Sand[/thing], and [thing=154587]Beast &amp; Master[/thing].

	<body>I think it&apos;s well documented, by now, how much I love Phil Eklund&apos;s designs. This has been on the wish list a long time, but the prohibitive price always kept me at bay.

Anyway... Tried not to stare too intently at this, because why tease yourself, right? Last night I found a listing on the geek market, for this and the expansion in very good condition - and for what I&apos;d call a fair price. So I watched &quot;Hello Gregor&quot;&apos;s commentary with some interest, then read through the geeklists for more of a feel of it, curiosity and excitement slowly building. 

And in those lists, time and again I&apos;m seeing contributions from the same handful of people who&apos;s tastes match up with my own. I was surprised to see so many of them have it. So, here&apos;s to you:

[user=CthulhuKid][/user] [user=Zouave][/user] [user=philmcd][/user] [user=often][/user] [user=patton55][/user]

And, in particular:

[user=eastwoodk][/user]

for a sustained campaign of evangelism. (Seriously, it&apos;s getting dangerous for me to read Kevin&apos;s posts.) 

And, with that, (hopefully) I&apos;m out of the grail business. </body>

	<body>After reading all of the posts about [thing=1032][/thing] by [user=jude][/user] I felt drawn to the multi-mission campaign style of the game. With B-17 being hard to find, I grabbed a copy of its sister game at my FLGS. B-29 differs from B-17 in that there is less combat and a greater struggle against the elements and the weaknesses of the aircraft. Curious to see how it plays.

This Imperial Settlers expansion waving from the shelf. &quot;Buy me for Professor Lindenbrook&quot; it said. Actually that is from the film Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1960) but what I really heard was myself asking &quot;How much is this?&quot; 

And so another item that was whispered in to my subconscious by reading last years SGoYT postings ends up purchased. 

My better half saw the playmat I came out of the shop wielding like a lightsabre but missed the expansion which was curled up quiet and contented in my coat pocket. Ah, the power of deep pockets and subtle misdirection.

	<body>Not sure who to blame for this one, but last year I saw lots of posts about The Hunters. 
When I started to look for that I saw that Silent Victory was on the P500 list, and it involves US Subs. I couldn&apos;t resist, so I signed on for my first P500 game. 
Just got it this week. I&apos;m looking forward to digging into the rules and getting it on the table. 
Never did order The Hunters by the way - it was too hard to find, and the thought of manning a US Sub won the day!

	<body>This purchase is only halfway due to SGOYT. Somewhere online, I saw an advertisement for the upcoming Widowers of the Wood board game and that caused me to dig deeper; eventually realizing that WotW is a follow-up to The Undercity. As far as SGOYT goes, posts by the below folks brought it into my consciousness over the past few months.

After one play, I can definitely say I&apos;m not sorry that I purchased it. Great game. The FedEx tracking originally said that it wouldn&apos;t arrive until next Tuesday 2/16. I&apos;m glad that it got to me earlier because they gave me a chance to try it before the WotW KS. Bring it on!</body>

	<body>Yes... What can I say. I am weak. I did not stick to my New Year&apos;s resolution to not buy any new games until GenCon.

I have been struggling with the thought to get this game for a while now. Two years back or so I began following Ebay listings for it because it is hard to get here in Germany.

[u]Why did I not buy it immediately?[/u]
- the some what trashy art and the theme itself. not sure if it could hook me like the Cthulhu mythos in Arkham does.
- I already have Arkham and Eldritch. And this game does kind of fall in the same mold.

[u]Why did I decide to buy it?[/u]
- I like Arkham a lot. But as it is I always play it solo. And there is the point where my brain starts to hurt. It is just very fiddly and hard to keep track of every item/ability each one of your character has. So I am always exhausted after a play.
Well, I heard Touch of Evil fixes that problem by reducing the bookkeeping aspects of Arkham and still telling a great story.

[u]Who is to blame?[/u]
[listitem=4366105]This SGOYT January 2016 entry.[/listitem]
And [user=jdarnold] for posting it, and making me once wonder about if I am missing out on something. So once I saw a ebay listing for 120 Euros for the base game plus all expansions I was very tempted. And finally decided to bid on it.
And of course [user=kerskine] for further convincing me that it is a good game, and that difficulty will be not a problem.
And [user=tragictheblathering] for making such a cool Let&apos;s Play and uploading it to YouTube.

I&apos;ve read a LITTLE bit of the rules of this game and quite frankly, it may be one that I like the IDEA of playing more than actually doing so. That said, it looks awesome and brings a theme to my collection that I don&apos;t already have. Looking forward to diving in some time in the next few weeks.</body>

	<body>Seems to be the month for expansions. After FFG turned their back on the base game, UK players had to watch with envy as the expansions solely rolled out in German. This brings a new, single, campaign but looks to add lots of replayability by having variable modules - such as bosses. 

The components look typically great. Figure I&apos;m doing my bit, picking this up. Hopefully they&apos;ll get the big box expansion to us soon.

Some of the minis have been painted so I have to decide what to do with the others. I can&apos;t paint but I&apos;m hoping a friends misses will do them once she has finished all their minis. I may have to bribe them with a play of the game or something else.

There are a few to blame for this one but it started with [user=Davekuhns][/user] so he can take most of the blame.

The rest of you aren&apos;t off the hook though and you know who you are so please feel bad. ;)

Really looking forward to this one. The theme is fantastic, the mental workout it provides seems great and some good design decisions allow you to focus on the space race (e.g. set amount of money per year means you don&apos;t have to focus on the budget and can concentrate on developing rockets and working out thrust to payload ratios, etc).

	<body>Traded [thing=127518][/thing] for this.
I&apos;ve noticed a real drop of in my interest to play wargames and a much larger drive to play fantasy, Sci-fi and Ameritrash.

I&apos;m still a voracious reader of military history but seem less interested in gaming it, the moral implications of what is represented by the cardboard chits on a map has weighed on my more heavily of late.

The more I read the less I want to game these situations, they&apos;re too important to game more and more.  Having said that I still own a large number of wargames but am finding that I&apos;m much more willing to part with them as time goes on.

	<body>So, this has been in my wheelhouse since I first laid eyes on it. I&apos;m intrigued by the stock market, and the Power Grid flavourings of the map. That it plays two players well, by trusted reviewer reputation, is a huge bonus... that the confirmed expansion boasts an AI solitaire opponent just made my wallet palpitate. 

And then I opened the box:

[imageid=2919339large]

Publishers who go cheap on packaging deserve to get nickel and dimed into poverty, replacing things that wouldn&apos;t have been damaged for the sake of a slip of polythene. I&apos;ve got a few dings and dents to the corners of the cardstock money, which I may ask to be replaced - because, frankly, there really is no excuse for this. 

Anyway... On to the slightly happier unboxing shot:

[imageid=2919341large]

It&apos;s a lovely board, the components are great quality; card art is simplistic/stylistic depending on your aesthetic leanings. 

A lean, well-done, twelve-page rulebook suggests it might be time to get a learn on. I have really high hopes for this. </body>

	<body>Thank you to

[user=Ibbo][/user]

 for posting his solo play of [thing=154906][/thing].  It arrived today and I&apos;m looking forward to giving it a try. 

After watching the reviews and the rules explanation I was immediately sure this would be a game I enjoyed. When I saw that you play cards horizontally as trains or virtically as good in the train cars, I was hooked. Plus, the incentives to interact with your opponent are great. 

Thanks Ibbo. </body>

	<body>This is the first of what I think will be many entries on this list.

I have only been a member of this guild for a couple of months, but snooping around here I found this game at an impressive #3 in the [listitem=4329071]2015 People&apos;s Choice Top 100 Solo Games list[/listitem].  I had never heard of this game before and thought it must be worth a look.

On a subsequent visit to the website of my favourite OLGS, I found this game, saw that there was only one copy left, and added it to my order.  It has arrived and remains unopened, but I expect it will get a run very soon.

I am fully in control of my game purchases (no, really - I am not addicted at all :)) but in the spirit of this list, I will blame all of the people who voted for this game in that poll.

	<body>I don&apos;t remember why I ended up subscribing to this game, but I did do that so I could see when it appeared on some auctions.  Not long later, I spotted a new in shrink copy on auction for $40 starting bid.  Heck yeah, sign me up.  I was the only one that bid for it, and the day the auction was supposed to close, the seller cancelled the geeklist.  I sent him a message saying I&apos;d still be interested in purchasing it, but only after I had posted a thread to the forum asking about buyer&apos;s recourse in this kind of situation.  I worked out a deal with the guy, and minutes later received a geekmail message from one of our own telling me he would sell me his copy which included Mission Pack 1.  Cancel deal with other wishy-washy guy and work out deal with guild member?  Um, yes please.  Therefore, [-]all the[/-] most of the blame for this purchase goes to 

[user=malaiser][/user]

for selling me his copy.  It arrived today.  The rest of you that own and post about this game get the remaining blame that is to be dispersed.  You&apos;re welcome.</body>

[username=Dubious Bryn]
and his [listitem=4493398]write up[/listitem] in the March SGoYT list.

I like the exploration theme and I am a map nerd, so took an instant liking to this.  I jotted the name of the game down and then promptly forgot about it.  Later, whilst hunting down more of the LOTR:LCG expansions and various local online stores, I saw this available, and after a few all-too-easy clicks was a little bit poorer, but a little bit happier.

I&apos;ve just nabbed it, as I&apos;ve noticed it&apos;s very tough to find in the wild, and I have no idea when it might be available again. 

Of course, I haven&apos;t put the minis together from the Swamps boxset, nor have I played a game with the Cynder expansion yet... But this seemed a vital pick-up, right now. Because I have [i]that[/i] sickness. Yeah, the same one you do. </body>

He put this game on my wishlist and PNP to-do list.  I found this recently in an action for a good price with some risk involved as the current owner never inventoried the parts.  But the owner he obtained it from confirmed at the time it was complete.  The box is beat up as expected but the contents look great.  I&apos;m excited to get this to the table after obtain my 4 year bachelor degree in Realms Speak.

Any tips to ease my entry into the Magic Realm?

EDIT: aside from the dice it&apos;s complete and in very good condition. Time to start studying.</body>

After withdrawing my pledge from Warfighter WWII, which I still think will be an awesome game, just maybe too much for me as I still have to squeeze more life out Modern Warfighter. I found myself with some extra funds destined to that game, so instead of saving up, as a good guild member I decided to spend it in new shiny games :shake:

So the time came to finally introduce this game to my collection, and probably the posts that finally pushed me into it were the ones from

I have to thank a geek that is not member of our guild,
[user=alien artefact][/user]
but nonetheless he put a deal in geek market that I couldn&apos;t refuse and got Space Empires 4x and its expansion. I threw in also Blackbeard, which I don&apos;t really know how well it plays the solo mode but seems interesting (I didn&apos;t have any pirate themed game) and has a solo mode.

It&apos;s exactly the kind of thing I enjoy, though, so I&apos;m pleased to have a chance to import it. 

Interesting take on how the deck-building works. The board looks serviceable, if not a tad plain, but I&apos;ve certainly enjoyed games with less of an obvious aesthetic. 

Plus, I did really well not splurging (too much) in the gameslore sale... and I&apos;m still managing not to buy Bright Future, yet. :whistle:</body>

Thanks to the enthusiastic post by one Anna H and the constant pushing of one mega fan (kerskine), I caved in, logged on to Miniature Market, and ordered a copy of this plus the High Caliber Ops expansion plus a copy of Conflict of Heroes: Firefight Generator. 

That happened 1 hour ago, and I am now reading the High Caliber Ops rules.
Let this be the last for the year please. (Umm, Jian, are you forgetting about Darkest Night?)

	<body>This did appear in some SGoYT entries, although I&apos;ll admit that other contributing factors were a) female designer and b) designer is a 1PGer.

When it came out there was no Canadian distribution.  I saw it today and grabbed a copy.  I was told they just got it in so I guess it is a recent turn of events.  I&apos;m hoping to break it out by the end of the weekend!

(Also hi SGoYT peeps - I hope to read a bit more of your exploits soon! I&apos;ve just been far too busy most of this year.  I still keep up to date on the &quot;made me buy this&quot; list though, I love the vicarious enjoyment of other people&apos;s new shinies.)</body>

	<body>This Guild is going to put me in the poor house (or on the couch). Also, I need to stop going to Half Price Books. I already grabbed [thing=41627][/thing] and [thing=169416][/thing] but this week... I found something on my list that I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d see, and I&apos;d only get it if it was reasonable.
 
I found it earlier this week but didn&apos;t have my fun money yet. Well, then I got my fun money. Guess where I stopped on my way home from work... hoping it was still there.

And there it was.... still on the shelf.

[ImageID=2987622medium]

It was $40... more than I&apos;d usually spend but, hey, it gets rave reviews and I know I&apos;ll never see it again. I snagged it, paid, and went on my merry way. I thought I got out cheap.

I went through the box and everything seemed there -- bagged up and organized nicely. I also found a set of cards in a bag and also in a plastic shell. 

[ImageId=2987623medium]

Oh, what? I think it&apos;s [thing=125376][/thing]! Wow what a deal.....

Again, I both love and loathe you people and SGOYT....</body>

	<body>I&apos;ve been eternally on the fence with this game, at least partly due to the high price point. When it showed up on SGYOT last week, I was intrigued that it could be (sort of) played solo. Then I found out the the expansion will include a solo module. And then I found out my buddy was selling his copy. At that point, I knew it was time to act!

I&apos;m placing the blame squarely on:

1) For his initial post[user=AnimalMkIV][/user]

2) For alerting me to impending solo module [user=klkitchens][/user]

3) For selling me his copy [user=chuggst3r][/user]</body>

	<body>SGoYT is only partially to blame here.  I did play this last year at a meet-up (5 player) and loved it, and had it on my radar.  But I was unaware that there was a solo option until my visit here.  So you really only hastened my purchase of this one.

Another difference is that most people are posting about the [thing=183394][/thing].  I happened to find both the [thing=128621][/thing] second edition and [thing=147101][/thing], in one FLGS in my town and bought them both on the spot (I was only going there to pick up some card sleeves).  I am not sure if this was the right decision, but so be it.  It now goes into the queue of games to be played. 

So cheers [microbadge=1911] to all the people who have posted about this in the last few months. </body>

	<body>There are just way to many people who have shared this on SGOYT to narrow this down to even just a few, let alone just one, who I could claim to be responsible for this game purchase - so I will just blame SGOYT and the 1PG in general for this one.  

This is a game that looked interesting to me from the start - but just never got around to picking it up.  Well, finally did, and have played it 3 times and I have to say that it has not disappointed me.  One of my three games specifically sticks out because it started really bad - by the third round I had two dead hostages and the threat track had raised to 6.  I thought for sure there was no way to win it - but slowly I was able to get the track back down - get three dice to roll, and the next think you know I am rescuing hostages.  And in the end, on the last turn, I was able to rescue the last hostage and the abductor surrendered.  What a game.   </body>

I had just finished checking out the Amazon game sale on Monday and, while I was tempted by [thing=127398][/thing] (not sure who to blame for that one!), I was going to be strong and resist the call of record low prices. But then he mentioned in the above [thing=171273][/thing] item that he ordered it and AC, I said, hmmm, what is this Apocalypse Chaos anyway?

A video later and again a really low price and BOOM - Legends and AC ordered. Oddly enough, Legends came same day, so by 8pm Monday I had that in my sweaty little hands. It took until this morning (whoa, almost 2 whole days!) for this to show up:

	<body>Not so much a &apos;SGOYT Made Me Buy&apos;, but more a &apos;1PG Made Me Buy&apos; item.

[user=ibbo][/user]
alerted the 1PG to Radho&apos;s Top 10 Solo Games - in which Town Center was #10.  TC has not had much SGOYT love over the years - 2 mentions of the base game, and 1 each for the New York/Paris expansion boards.

Anyways, Abstract games were the preferred genre in my previous gaming phase, so a bit of research and I was intrigued enough to get the base game.

Having got a few plays in - I would like to [-]blame[/-] [b]thank[/b] Ibbo. I have even gone direct and bought 3 of 4 Expansions; Essen/Spiel being out of print.  However there is this note on the website;

[q]NOTE: Due to a production error, this expansion (Beaune/Turku) ships with the Essen / SPIEL rulesheet. We are also including the corrected sheet in each package.[/q]
As Ludi Creations kindly display the board layouts in the description a PNP solution may be possible.</body>

	<body>So this game first caught my attention last month when I saw 

[user=davekuhns][/user] and [user=mo7189][/user] 

report on playing the Shadow Conspiracy solo variant created by 

[user=the_demolished_man][/user]

Then when I saw both 

[user=davekuhns][/user]  and   [user=mo7189][/user] 

report on play testing the upcoming expansion: Helionox: Mercury Protocol which is currently up on kickstarter ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/532062403/helionox-mercury-protocol ) I just knew I had to check this game out.  

So I am going to lay blame on all three of them for this addition to my game collection - oh, and for backing the upcoming expansion as well.  (which by the way could use a little help funding still, so if this looks interesting to you at all, go buy it and then back the expansion in the next four days.)</body>

So here I am with Helionox.  Leafing through the cards I feel a bit of &quot;oh. Why did I buy another deckbuilder.&quot; ... but hopefully it will prove to be a good one.

While I was at it I grabbed [thing=168215]Saboteur: Le Duel[/thing] which I&apos;d never heard of but is 1-2 players.  Probably because it&apos;s only been released in French and German that I know of.  But hey, I can handle French.  At least I hope I can! :D

I don&apos;t remember a single person being the first inspiration nor the death blow in this purchase so I guess I blame all of you by association.</body>

	<body>I am a big [thing=30549][/thing] fan.  I think it is an amazing game design, being an excellent example of a game that blends the tight gameplay of euros with the randomness of cards to come up with tight, fun, and varied gameplay.

Blame is easily assigned to:
[user=Moe45673][/user] who has been an constant supporter of this expansion, but given that I was still enjoying the base game, I had the luxury of waiting (close to a year!) for a deal.  Amazon finally had this as their Deal of the Day and I pounced!

	<body>When I first started into this hobby I had no idea what I was getting into.  And then I found this site and I realized I really really really had no idea what the hobby had in store for me.  Those first few months I read everything I could I find on games - and the 1 Player Guild, and specifically SGOYT became a main source of information for me.  

It was during that time I came across two games that looked very interesting to me.  Assault on Doomrock and Dungeon Crawler.  I had a very hard time getting my mind around the concept of both of these games, but I knew I was interested in them.  So I marked them down in my collection&apos;s wishlist and even bookmarked the web site for Dungeon Crawler for future use, but did nothing else with them.  

That is until recently.  When I saw Dungeon Crawler&apos;s recent Kickstarter for &quot;The Thorn&quot; During the campaign I kept bouncing back and forth from wanting to back it, to not wanting to back it.  To wanting to go all in, to only wanting to get the base game and the newest expansion.  It was after another campaign didn&apos;t fund and I decided not to back another one, and talking with one of the people I am about to blame for this game acquisition, I finally decided to go all in. (I realize now that my hesitation wasn&apos;t because I wasn&apos;t sure if I wanted the game, it was from the fact that if I was going to get the game I wanted all of the game and I wasn&apos;t sure I wanted to spend that much) I backed for both expansions and all five delve packs and ordered the base game off of the web site (that way I could start playing before the expansions made it to me later in the year).  Then, this last Saturday I walked in to a FlAGS and saw the base game sitting on a 50% off table.  For $12 I couldn&apos;t not pick it up - so I guess I am going to end up with two copies of the base game. So who are the responsible 1 Player Guild members?

In the beginning it was these two who brought my attention to the game:

[user=garyrbrooks][/user]

for his post in Oct 2015 (which should come as no surprise because he was responsible for pointing me to many of the games I purchased early in the hobby - as I am sure is also true for many more than just me) and 

[user=eastwoodk][/user]

For his post in Sept 2015.  But the one that I blame the most for the final purchase?  That would be:

[user=kerskine][/user]

(do you think it is a coincident that these three are the top users of Dungeon Crawler according to the SGOYT Aggregator?) 

I knew he played the game and I had talked with him about other games in the past so I asked him what his thoughts were on it.  As he tried to explain to me why he liked the game but that other people (and this could include me) might not like the game, all he did was make me want to play it even more.  So thanks Kevin for the final push to pick up one of the games I first saw when I started researching this hobby.  But wait - that is not all Mr. Kerskine is responsible for...

[user=kerskine][/user]

I can not remember who first brought my attention to this game, but he is the person responsible for me now owning it.

While talking with him about the previouse game (Dungeon Crawler) I mentioned to him that I had been trying to make a deal for the game with another person, but before I could get the deal worked out someone else beat me to the purchase. (I was :ninja:ed)  He graciously offered to sell me his copy of the game - which was the Kickstarter for the second edition base game and the expansion Doompocalypse.  So thanks again Kevin for helping get another one of the early games that caught my attention.  You are a good friend to have in the hobby :laugh:  </body>

	<body>Well, he was wondering if he could make three in a row, and I didn&apos;t want to let him down, so without further delay I blame:

[user=kerskine][/user]

I started to take notice of this game on the 2015 peoples choice list (so I guess I could also blame everyone who voted for it on that) which Kerskine hosted.  And then I remember him telling me how much he liked it in another conversation I had with him, so when I saw a copy of it a few months back at a FLAGS I picked it up....

You know, I think I am seeing a pattern here Kevin - I talk with you about games and then I end up spending money. :whistle: Maybe I should stop talking to you about games? What do you think?.... :shake:

That gives you three in a row - if you want four you are going to have to hope someone else posts it because I am not going too (even if I did have another one I could blame you for - don&apos;t want to make you feel too bad for spending my money. :D )</body>

	<body>I blame a bunch of you for this one, including:

[user=kerskine][/user]

[user=eastwoodk][/user]

and

[user=garyrbrooks][/user]

This is the first game on my last available shelf! Once that shelf is full it is one-in-one-out and expansions that fit in base game boxes only. I have reserved spots for [thing=187617][/thing] and [thing=169786][/thing], so that leaves me about 6 or 7 more games after that. I am trying to choose very carefully now. Glad I picked this one up though, I don&apos;t have a ton of deckbuilders, and this seems like a suitably challenging one with lots of replayability.</body>

I think you know the rest - rated #1 on people&apos;s choice, lots of SGoYT entries, so often used as a comparison when talking about other games, etc.

So I am going to blame all of you.

	<body>There wasn&apos;t one entry in SGOYT, but several, and I subscribed to the game (as I often do when I want to make up my mind about something). What really made me buy the game was in fact a thread that complained about the game&apos;s difficulty: [thread=1575840][/thread]

Eventually, I went ahead and bought it. It&apos;s really neat indeed; in fact, I&apos;m going to play it again right after writing this entry. Tough and challenging, very thematic (particularly considering the relatively minimalist set of components) and with a lovely campaign with character development, gear acquisition, everything a proper miniature RPG should have.

There&apos;s some fear that FFG might not add expansions for the game, and it would be a pity - it&apos;s definitely made to support different scenarios. But the replayability with just this one game is relatively high, too - the end goal of each quest is the same, but because of the variety of locations and enemies, and the different comboes of heroes, games will definitely play out different each time you try them.

The mechanisms are a neat mix between [thing=71721][/thing] (particularly the actions, where you exhaust cards after using them and get special bonuses for them depending on which [-]team[/-] hero you activate them with) and [thing=77423][/thing] (locations and enemies behave rather similarly).</body>

- [thing=137095]Witches[/thing] is solo-able, but not my cup of tea.

[user=garyrbrooks][/user]

Whilst shopping for Clacks in one OLGS, it was under their Free Shipping so I needed a basket filler.  As it was when I went to checkout Clacks was out-of-stock, so went elsewhere.  While in OLGS #2 I didn&apos;t need a basket filler I decided to get this anyway.

Only 1 SGOYT mention of this and the [thing=184371]Batman[/thing] version, but it looks good for it&apos;s price.  Wary of Collector-itis, as that will quickly turn a Dice Filler into an expensive game, tho&apos; I am watching to see which Heroes are in the queue.

[i]Being Superhero&apos;s this will go down will go down well with the Gateway Gamers Friends - and maybe they will buy their preferred Hero and save my wallet.[/i]</body>

	<body>UK Games Expo related really but I need to assign some blame. :D

This could have been about [thing=55690][/thing] or even [thing=161936][/thing].  I heard very good arguments in favour of both that are putting my natural resistance to both (miniature building and no interested in Pandemic) to the test.

However, it was [user=dave in ledbury][/user] who showed me his copy of this.

He started by saying his gaming group hated it but then spoke about the solo variant which he thinks is really good.

I couldn&apos;t get it out of my head so I watched a play through, checked the availability and price (available and cheap) and took the plunge.

Should be here by early next week at the latest.</body>

	<body>And into the abyss I go! Impossible to blame a single person for this one, as everyone seems to be playing it. I hate to sound like a broken record, but I really don&apos;t grok deck builders, so I&apos;m surprised I enjoyed this one so much on Vassal. I guess because it is more of a deck creator, so it is a different meta game than building your deck in game, that makes it so much fun. That, and the mechanics of playing are really interesting. For all you boardgame manufacturers out there, this is exhibit #1 of how a good Vassal module can lead to a hard copy sale. Think I&apos;ll bring this one to Maine with me today for our long weekend / short vacation at the camper.</body>

	<body>So many folks to blame for this one. Plus I was already tempted due to my love of Fire in the Lake. Hoping the shorter play time of Cuba Libre gets it to the table more often than FitL. I do love the size/depth/complexity of FitL but I need a few days of dedicated gaming time to really get into it; Cuba Libre looks like a faster playing option for my COIN fix!

Special thanks to [user=moe45673][/user] who paid to reserve a copy for me at the FLGS so that it wouldn&apos;t go out of stock while I was laid up in the hospital. Moe is an excellent human being and a wonderful friend, I am proud to know (and game with) him!</body>

A bunch of recent posts on this iteration of the IS game engine, plus the Ant Lab Games video playthrough of the solo game, convinced me to buy this one instead. I definitely prefer the post-apocalyptic theme of this and reading up on the gameplay differences I think I will prefer this to Imperial Settlers.

Ordering it by itself would have cost me the same in postage as for the game itself. So when a group order from Germany for LE and its new expansion came up, I jumpedon the bandwagon and ordered the base game.

	<body>I was tempted by the original Kickstarter for this, then I was re-tempted when people started posting on SGOYT, but it wasn&apos;t until I played [user=fortheloveofdice]fortheloveofdice[/user]&apos;s copy with her and [user=mikemartins]mikemartins[/user] last night that I finally caved.

After our amazing playthrough last night I just had to have a copy, so a bit of time on Kijiji last night and a trip out to meet someone at a Starbucks today and I am the proud owner of a Premium Edition (with the metal coins) AND the oversized board add-on.

So stoked, it is punched, sorted and bagged ready for me to finish lunch and set it up for my first solo play. My girlfriend is printing off an extra set of the Automa cards at work so I can try playing against two automas later this week.

I have only had one game of this so far, but it is one of the most interesting and elegant games I have ever played. So glad I got my own copy.

This is the 97th game in my collection (all of them playable solo with official/unofficial variants), when you add in the copy of Navajo Wars I am buying from moe45673 and the copy of Nemo&apos;s War I have coming from Kickstarter later this year that gets me one game away from 100!

for posting about this in the current SGOYT GL. His posts put the game on my radar and spying a keen price for it online I decided to give it a go. After my first play I am very glad I did! :D Thanks Luiz.</body>

Put this on the radar - but further research shows it should be a good fit for me.

www.BoardGamePrices.co.uk comes thru again and shows a OLGS, Pevans,  I have never heard of has the lowest price.  
At check-out the final price drops as it&apos;s on sale - seemingly Pevans don&apos;t update the main listing with sale prices.  :D</body>

I first spotted this on the list back in February and it looked an interesting topic for a game.  I then saw this get regular the entries since then.  The pictures of the game all looked fascinating.

Postage direct from the designer was prohibitive.  So I had to wait until the release of the Outer Planets expansion, when a supplier here did a bulk order (of it and the base game) and I joined a group purchase from my city.  Both arrived in the last few days.

I have opened it up and it looks even more fascinating.  I know the blame thing is tongue-in-cheek, but I can&apos;t bring myself to &quot;blame&quot; anyone for this one as I am so pleased with it.

	<body>The thanks (blame?) all goes to [user=zouave][/user] for his post to this month&apos;s SGOYT. Never heard of the game before, but I&apos;m a sucker for big, epic looking games, especially if you get to roll dice. And at only US$16.90, including shipping and it got here in 6 days. Not bad at all. I have already grabbed the 2nd edition of the rules (reading through the ones in the box showed some pretty amazing holes, like how actions are selected), so I&apos;m looking forward to giving this a spin.</body>

	<body>I recieved a geekmail about a week ago from another BGG User who had seen a game I had marked for trade that he was interested in.  Looking through his list at first I didn&apos;t see anything that caught my eye - so I looked back a little closer and noticed [thing=34219][/thing] and Zulus on the Ramparts.  I had been interested in Biblios for a while, but it was remembering all of the entries from June on Zulus that got me to considering if I wanted to trade.  After re-reading the entries I was sold and ready to make the trade.  So it is because of all the entries in June, but most specifically:

[user=suzyvitale][/user]

[user=koinskyz][/user]

And 

[user=Longbombed][/user]

Because it was these three entries that made the name of the game stick out to me.  I am happy to say the trade went perfect and now I have a copy of the game sitting on my table waiting to be played ... now to just find the time.  </body>

	<body>This has been a game that has tempted me for years, but the lack of a solo option for the main game kept it off my list.

Then [user=shaungamer][/user] posted about his solo plays, using his AI, and I was safe no more. 

His AI, &quot;Mekastein&quot; uses a large POP figure (he used Ultron, I picked up Black Manta instead). With a simple set of AI rules the large figure acts as a &quot;big boss&quot; for your team to take down.

I also picked up a POP figure of Pinhead (from Hellraiser) to create my own AI card for!

Thankfully my wallet is safe (at least from this one) as I found a copy for trade, ditching some games that I never play in exchange for the base game plus:

[thing=141998][/thing]

I wanted to resist buying games this month (apart from Hostage Negotiator kickstarter which was a must) but today the alert of new stock arrived and for that price I just couldn&apos;t resist.

Shop is called Hexasim, is from France, but shipping was quite good (82€ with shipping to UK, the cheapest I&apos;ve seen). Another user told me about this one in the Dawn of Zeds forum. I don&apos;t have anything to do with the shop, but knowing you guys, some of you might be interested in this while stock lasts :whistle:

	<body>So after playing a few euro games with the new game group I&apos;ve been going the few last weeks, I started to get an itch to play more of those in my now few moments of solo game (I need to get back on track!). 

To be fair I&apos;ve been looking a lot for At the gates of Loyang without success, I&apos;ve almost bought the french edition, language is not going to be a problem for me, but in case I get to play this one with a friend they&apos;ll probably get a hard time with not being in English. So I&apos;ll just wait for the reprint later this year :)

So after reading through the forums (what happened that in the last couple of weeks there has been so many people asking for Euros?) my decision was between 3 games:
- Fields of Arle
- Glass Road
- La Granja

First one got discarded because it was very hard to find, and to be fair I wasn&apos;t that sure about the static start. I have Caverna, which I love, and play sometimes solo, but the same start always puts me off a bit to have another one like that. So after some research I finally decide to go with Glass Road, at the end mainly for the play time and the enthusiasm [user=reverendunclebastard][/user] always has with this one. So hopefully, this weekend I&apos;ll mainly play Glass Road and Dawn of Zeds.
I haven&apos;t discarded La Granja, it looks very good too, so it might be a future purchase for me :)

I&apos;m also looking very closely to that great looking &quot;A feast for Odin&quot;, hopefully will have a great solo mode :D</body>

	<body>I have liked the show Firefly for some time, but the first time I saw this game I wasn&apos;t very interested in it.  Not sure why, but it caused me to not look into it much past that point... that is until I saw 

[user=reverendunclebastard][/user] 

do a post talking about his variant to solo play that he has been working on it.  For some reason it got my attention and I added to my wish list.  From that point, it only took another fellow BGG user messaging me to try to make a trade to work out a deal with him to buy the game from him.  Should get it some time this week.  Can&apos;t wait to try it out.</body>

	<body>First time posting on this list. Sure there was other game I bought because primarly of SGoYT but none were like this one and i&apos;m not a big poster. I read a lot of thread but do not participate that much.

I got this after almost a year of reading about it in SGOYT and following all the comments each time. I was on the fence because I was not seeing myself playing it enough to profit from the  upgrade system which was not fast according to many.

I hold off as long as I could. Then there was a 30% sale at a store near only monday and only on boardgames, I had to get it!

5 plays in 24 hours and I don&apos;t regret it at all. Fast setup, play fast (which is a big plus for me). Really brutal but I already succeded a crossfire mission and a succesful abort. I need to reread the rules to make sure I didn&apos;t miss anything but I don&apos;t think so.


I have to thank [user=Kerskine][/user] with his constant promotion of the game, the top 100 and the many others members who post about it almost every week!


I will need to return to the SGOYT post to read some of the advices given?

I should have bought way before yesterday!</body>

	<body>Well, SGOYT Made Me Trade For This if you are being particular... :D

In a recent discussion about miniatures games on the 1PG [user=bgm1961][/user] mentioned this game. It looked great!

A little research indicated that there is a deck of AI cards available for solo play, and a little more research uncovered the fact that a guy I am already trading with in a few weeks also has it up for trade.

I perusal of my game shelf led to finding a couple of games I never play, so here I am, awaiting the arrival of yet another tactical minis game (my favourite kind of game)!</body>

	<body>This is for Shadows of Malice and its expansion - 

When this game first started showing up on SGOYT I didn&apos;t pay much attention to it.  In fact, the first couple of pictures of it I saw didn&apos;t interest me at all and so I didn&apos;t really read many of the post about the game.  That is until earlier this month when 

[user=Phate999][/user]

Posted about the game with a lot of great pictures and multiple updates as he worked through a full play through of the game.  Not sure what caught my eye this time, but I read through the post and then added it to my wish list.  And then 

[user=repairmanjack][/user]

posted about getting the latest promo&apos;s for it and how much he liked the game and I started noticing it show up on a lot of lists as peoples favorites.  I watched a play through from 

[user=Dougmysticeye][/user]

and that was all it took to put the game at the to the top of my wishlist.  Finding what I thought was a good deal of the game and its expansion was all it took for me to take the plunge and pick this one up - so I guess I am going to lay credit on the three above for this one.

Now I just need someone to point me in the direction of where I can get the promos for the game...

Boy, I really need to stop reading these threads - it is really contributing to my problem of getting to many games :whistle:....lol</body>

The art and the concept looked very interesting, and then I followed the link to the Kickstarter for the expansion and saw how affordable it was with such a small game box and I was hooked. I backed for the main game and the expansion so now I&apos;m just waiting now for the expansion to be finished so I can get the game. </body>

	<body>It&apos;s that old devil called &quot;Rev&quot; again...

I pulled out of the Kickstarter at the eleventh hour, as there weren&apos;t really any extras, and I always figured I&apos;d grab this at retail. Tom Vasel loved it but, more importantly, the Reverend did. That makes it pretty much essential for me. 

That said, I would happily have grabbed the expansion at the same time, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen a release marred by so many bloody typos and component errors. Will grab it when they fix it, but for now I&apos;m slightly bewildered how so much of this slipped through. Kudos to them, though, for the fixes they&apos;re putting into place. Will also grab the White Whale promo when it appears in the store. </body>

	<body>It&apos;s been mentioned in our guild a few times and, having waited patiently, I&apos;ve watched it sell out the second it hit stores on Friday. Have grabbed a copy for the solo campaign mode, because I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ll still be able to if I wait a week. 

Grabbing this puts the new Brimstone expansion (still got a base game to build) on the potential Christmas list, along with the new Runebound and Mansions of Madness expansions.

Still can&apos;t make my mind up about The Pursuit of Happiness. Is it that replayabie as a solo game?</body>

	<body>£8 on Amazon, when I have a £7 voucher to cash in, makes this a steal. I might have left it alone, save for the fact that the [thing=209323][/thing] expansion, released in Essen, is on such a limited run that there&apos;s no telling if and when it&apos;ll be published again. It adds a dedicated solo mode and campaign style play/a changing narrative. It&apos;s available from the publisher&apos;s website. Three hundred copies and when they&apos;re gone they&apos;re gone. 

And that&apos;s all I&apos;m clamouring for, with Essen releases, this year. Hey, I&apos;m surprised myself. (Mind you, the KS haul begins in earnest soon...)</body>

That is right - much like Garry (Who&apos;s that?), I am going to lay the blame for this on your shoulders.  Never mind the fact that I already thought it looked interesting.  Never mind the fact that I saw a few others talk about it before you did.  Never mind the fact that I had already decided that I would probably pick it up &quot;one day&quot;.  It was your posts that caused me to not be able to wait for the second printing and I went out and found a copy of it on Ebay and had it sent to me from the UK (all the way to the US because apparently there were no more copies to be found in the US)... and I just want to say....

I haven&apos;t been playing much in the last few months, and have too many unplayed games (including some previous ones on this list).  As such, I haven&apos;t been looking to buy anything more recently.  But a second hand copy of this hard-to-find title came up ... and I cracked.

I am actually quite pleased with the purchase.  It is a 3rd edition and looks like it has not been played.  At first I thought the cars were missing until I spied them with my electron microscope.  Apparently I also now need to investigate what a SISU is.  And any other changes from this to the 4th edition.  Any advice here is welcome.  

And please don&apos;t mention Dirt (does this never end?).

	<body>These are all the games I purchased or traded for in the last few months, along with the person or persons to blame.

[thing=135382][/thing]
Thanks to Kevin Erskine&apos;s campaign. This game is perfect for solo play. A great puzzle with a learning curve, quick to set up, shortish play time, separate plays are connected (earned Karma) but there are no components that need to be saved between games, small footprint, small box (because I crammed everything I need for solo in the expansion box). I really like pure card games with no dice. (Note: I didn&apos;t really cram anything. Natural gamer OCD forbids this. It was more like gently and precisely placed.) This game received some early negative reviews due to being too difficult. So what a nice surprise to discover it is a great solo game.

[thing=171233][/thing]
Thanks to Kevin Erskine again. He was right about Shadowrun Crossfire and that is good enough for me. Plus I might also play it co-op. Only received it today so no plays yet.

[thing=153623][/thing]
Thank you person who played this game over 400 times. You know who you are. (Edit: it&apos;s Morten Pedersen). You made me curious to see what the fuss is all about. Five minutes per game sounds amazing.

[thing=143693][/thing]
Thanks to everyone in SGOYT for comparing this to Gates of Loyang. 

[thing=121297][/thing]
Thank you peoples choice top 100 for 2015. Glad this made the cut. Very relaxing game with great theme and surprising depth.

[thing=176524][/thing]
Thank you Ricky Royal for claiming this is better than Mage Knight, and that very nice local person who sold it to me.

[thing=142854][/thing]
Thanks again to everyone in SGOYT.

[thing=179275][/thing]
SGOYT again. So much excitement around this. Calm down people. Also I really admire the designers use of space. Efficient, compact, and tiny box. Perfect. Oh, it seems to be a fun game (after one play). 

[thing=173064][/thing]
I don&apos;t know where I saw this thing but I am pretty sure one of you is to blame. This is like Kerbal Space Program the board game. The box is also amazingly small for what is inside. This might be the only game I was sure I would like before even playing it.

[thing=156009][/thing]
Another game that I am not sure who it was that brought it to my attention. But thank you. Also, it was one of you wasn&apos;t it?

[thing=154203][/thing]
I just like the cute art. You are off the hook on this one.

Whew! I am glad I got this off my chest. I know we like to make jokes about spending too much and we use the word blame with a wink (and I did too). But we don&apos;t really feel that way at all. I am really happy to have these games and grateful to the Solo Guild for bringing them to my attention.

P.S. Most of my collection is due to the 1-Player Guild. This list was only for those games that I acquired in the last FEW months because of you all. But you are basically to blame for almost every game I have. Keep up the good work.  </body>

	<body>Okay, I&apos;ll admit I have been very lax about posting in here. In reality, almost every game I purchase could be put on this list as probably 75% of my purchases are heavily influenced by SGOYT and the 1PG.

This one belongs quite honorably to:

[user=boulou][/user] 

and

[user=repairmanjack][/user]

I somewhat remember glancing at the Kickstarter and apparently deciding to pass. Then I started some buzz about this as backers got it and I&apos;ll admit that I was squarely in the camp of: a rondel (two actually) in a dungeon crawl - oh the horror! However, after seeing posts by these two lovely guild members and watching a few of Rahdo&apos;s videos, I was sold.

I was able to get a Kickstarter edition off the Marketplace for a decent price. It hasn&apos;t arrived yet, but I can&apos;t wait until it does!</body>

Considering they already had a slight discount from retail price, and I had a little change in old birthday vouchers languishing about, this seems like a good time. I walked away from it, initially, as it needed an Overlord... but MoM has shown me how good an app can be at taking over that role. 

And I see another free big campaign is coming to it soon.

I checked the website and realised I´d have to pay the same amount for shipping it here as I´d pay for the game and took it off my buy-list and put it on the wishlist for some unknown time in the future...

At the FLGS today however it stood just next to the game I was there to get ([thing=180564][/thing] for my son), pricetag very low (as if just paying for the game with no shipping) and I just couldn´t help myself...</body>

	<body>This is another one that I bought thanks to the People&apos;s Choice. I didn&apos;t get it when it first came out because my groups tend to dislike games with high stress, and real-time games fall into that category. Also, I&apos;m not a fan of companion apps, mainly because few companies make them available for the Kindle, which is my only mobile device. (At least with this one the app isn&apos;t required.)

Making a reasonable showing as a solo game put it back on my wishlist, since I don&apos;t have to please the tastes of others in order to get use out of it.</body>

Trying to stick to one per month (although stuff is now arriving from Kickstarter, over the next few, but at least I&apos;m at the happy end of that process now). 

So, several people have been enjoying this, but I think it was [user=Busdjur][/user] posting about it last. I&apos;ve been trying to order it for a few days actually but the website seems to be down. Happily, Vermin Games are also selling it via eBay, so I&apos;ve grabbed it from there instead. 

No more game buying until next payday then.

This is a SGoYT made me math trade for this item. I blame everybody who&apos;s ever posted a play, as they had a cumulative effect in shaping my desire for this game. While the copy I got was 1st Edition, it did come with the first three expansions, so I feel like I lucked out. I&apos;m going to print out Version 3 of the rules and get to learning it. If I like it the game I&apos;ll order the Footlocker for the replacement cards and better storage.


[ImageID=326493 inline][ImageID=468222 inline]

I also traded for A Touch Of Evil with the Something Wicked expansion. While I can&apos;t directly blame SGoYT for this, as my decision was mostly based on posts from a user on a G+ boardgame group, the few posts I&apos;ve seen on SGoYT certainly didn&apos;t hurt.</body>

	<body>Bet nobody expected this to show up!


A flawed, fiddly, super-long game, works with 3-5 out of the box and has a 40-page solo variant??? 

Granted, I didn`t buy buy this for solo...I`m not that crazy. I actually traded [thing=146278][/thing], which was a miss for us, for it. After a math trade an user contacted me about Tash-Kalar (which I had put up for trade but did not succeed) telling me she really wants it and maybe I want to check out her trade list? Nothing really interested me there, except this beast right here. I knew it was 3+ and that I would never get my regular gaming friends to sit down for a 4 hour game of this, so I thought: maybe check the aggregator and see if it works solo? I did, found a couple of favourable session reports from years ago, good enough for me. 

So literally nothing beside SGOYT would have made me consider this.
God knows when I`ll actually muster the courage to try it, it looks daunting. So I guess...thanks SGOYT? Maybe? :zombie:</body>

	<body>Ok, so I am going to blame everyone who has posted about this game.  That includes January and especially in February - and there are a lot of you and a lot of posts...

But I am pointing direct fingers at 

[user=mournful][/user]  

and 

 [user=Kerskine][/user]

Luke&apos;s wonderful write up of the game is what first got me interested in it.  When I first started looking into games I had missed the kickstarter for this one (didn&apos;t know what kickstarter was) but I ran across Gloomhaven and Gloom of Kilforth.  Kilforth interested me way more (and still is my most anticipated game) so I got a late backing of it and promptly forgot about Gloomhaven.  That is until Luke started posting about it...great write ups by the way.

And Kevin... well, lets just say that my gaming tastes seem to run very close to Kevin&apos;s.  If he likes a game and has picked it up chances are good that I will not regret doing the same.  So when I saw that he was looking for the game I knew it was now just a mater of when, not if.  Thanks for spending my money again Kevin.

I had thought that I would not be able to get a copy of this until the reprint when I started hearing about the shortage for the preorders.  But a buddy of mine, 

[user=echarlie][/user] 

(who is not a part of the guild but still responsible for me getting it) came across it at a small &quot;hole in the wall&quot; game store (as he put it) and offered it to me... I few games from my collection sold later and I was picking it up from him.  Can&apos;t wait to play it.</body>

Which was the only thing that kept stopping me from backing the game in the first place when it was on kickstarter...

Anyway, blame for this falls both on:

	<body>I&apos;m blaming everybody who ever posted a play of this for this purchase. I&apos;ve been wanting to get a copy since I first started reading SGoYT (November 2015). I kept seeing 1st print run copies available for trade, but had been holding out for a 2nd printing copy, due to the corrections they made. This just randomly showed up at my FLGS last Friday, which was totally weird since the game was never even available to them in the past. I think it had to do with my FLGS receiving a copy of the creators other game (I dare not speak it&apos;s name!). Either way, I snatched up a copy as soon as I heard they&apos;d received it.</body>

	<body>Ok, there really is three that are responsible for this - first, everyone on the SGOYT list that keeps reporting their plays for the challenge times.  They got me looking at the game in the beginning.  But the two that are most responsible for me actually getting this are:

[user=uniconfis][/user] 

For his post here on this list (just above me) where he told how he got such a great deal on it from a store in Canada... and 

[user=jdarnold][/user]

For actually sharing the information for the hot deal for it at that store to begin with.  

This was a game that I was interested in to begin with, and was trying to put together a trade for it last week that fell through, but the deal on this one was just way to good to pass up.  35 CAD shipped (converted to just at $26 usd) was just unbelievable.  Even if I end up not liking this game (which I do not think will happen) there will be nothing really lost.  Now to start looking into those monthly races I always hear about on here...</body>

	<body>So yesterday I ordered Core Worlds and the main reason is

 [user=mo7189][/user]

I wanted to order the expansion too but the store was out of stock and didn&apos;t know when it will be back in stock. I saw it for 3$ pricier on amazon so if I like the base game I will probably get it from amazon with free shipping.

I also ordered Sentinels of the Multiverse expansion : Shattered Timelines because they now have a &quot;combo box&quot; with Wrath of the cosmos which I already have and fear Shattered Timelines will be difficult to get later.
And Mage Knight expansion Krang that I wanted for sometime but never bought...

It will help wait for some kickstarter coming late spring and late summer.</body>

I recently watched Ant Lab Games&apos;s solo runthrough and it made me decide that I [b]really[/b] had to have the game. To my chagrin, I discovered on the forum that the game is now entirely out of print and probably won&apos;t see a reprint for at least a couple years.

	<body>When the Kickstarter campaign began, I promised myself I wouldn&apos;t buy this. My gaming groups are strongly opposed to any game containing conflict. Even if it&apos;s just a minor part of the game, the conflict is still too much in this one.

The game started showing up on the SGoYT lists. I scrolled past all the reports. Not gonna buy it. Nope. It&apos;ll never get played.

The game made an impressive showing on the People&apos;s Choice Top 100. Reports continued to pour in. People excitedly announced being able to play against multiple Automa opponents with additional decks.

Well...I told myself that if I saw it show up in a math trade, I&apos;d add it to my list. Couldn&apos;t hurt.

Threads popped up discussing whether it was worth buying exclusively for solo. The game was passionately defended.

I suppose...if I ever found it at a deep discount...nah, that&apos;ll never happen.

	<body>I&apos;ve never played a &quot;Legacy&quot; game and as someone who pretty much just plays solo, this one especially seemed pointless. And give the price point well outside US$70, I figured I could easily keep ignoring it.

But then [user=DocSavage2001][/user] started posting about it and as someone who has zero problems playing multiple characters or even sides in games (I&apos;m a solo wargamer from way back), I got a little more interested. The theme seemed fun and the game play cool.

But still, the price was way too high. Until CSI had it on sale for a week at US$25 - guess they weren&apos;t moving too fast, as they had a bunch. So I jumped on it (and threw in [thing=180539][/thing] to help spread out the US$5.99 shipping). 

Now I have it set up and ready to go and I&apos;m feeling just a little overwhelmed. But it sure is pretty!</body>

	<body>I saw it so many times, I traded for it. It doesn&apos;t play as fast for me as it does for you guys, but one of my meds fusses my brain a bit. That one time I died three encounters in was fast, though.

The only time I have won was two player with my husband, and we w
Hadn&apos;t yet understood that there were one and two player sides to the cards, so I think we were too powerful.  Still getting tail kicked on Dragon, but it&apos;s fun. I don&apos;t have the bandwidth to remember all the changes for 1.5 so maybe I should print them.

It&apos;s 1.0 version I traded for, I did kickstarter the expansion, and an upgrade for this to 1.5. Which is it ten dollars less than buying it all over, but I&apos;ve got it to play now.

However, if I never get off Dragon, it might eventually get traded, fun though it is.  I think I prefer it solo. </body>

So, after buying [thing=166571][/thing] in Essen and [thing=160669][/thing] a couple of months ago, I finally decided to track down a copy of [thing=130486][/thing].

It was really, really expensive, but already worth it! I can see me playing it quite a lot.

So I [-]curse[/-] [-]thank[/-] blame [user=Hrune] for making me buy this! And everyone else who kept posting about it! But he was the one who put it on my radar. And I hope you&apos;re still around, Arne, so you know that you should feel guilty about something :)</body>

/hangs head

I&apos;ve misbehaved.

Have wanted this pretty much since the day it went out of print in its initial run. Waited ages for the second run, baulked at the price hike (and I think we know what to blame that on in the UK), and there was no way I was asking for something that expensive as a birthday present. 

I&apos;ve watched it start to resurface a bit here again, but it was unusually Rahdo&apos;s playthrough I stuck on earlier that finally cemented I still really wanted it. I do love Uwe&apos;s games, after all.

And I found one online retailer doing it for around £15 less than everyone else, with free postage. Figured it was time.

And, as I had my wallet out, I threw DPD an extra fiver to chivvy along the delivery of my copy of Sword &amp; Sorcery. It&apos;ll now be here some time tomorrow.</body>

His post about this game really piqued my interest. I owned the Sergeants Miniatures game some years back, but felt it was a bit overly complex for what it was and the small number of included soldiers meant your battles were small. I didn&apos;t want to invest the extra money to buy more soldiers for a game I wasn&apos;t feeling warm and fuzzy about. This seems like a more streamlined and accessible version.</body>

I was immediately intrigued by his descriptions of his plays and his photos. It seems like the game is just now arriving in the U.S. so I was watching like a hawk for a copy to appear in the wild. There was a guy in the U.S. who had it listed for trade so I contacted him and asked him if he&apos;d be willing to sell it. He hadn&apos;t received it yet, but said he&apos;d let me know when it arrived. Well, he got it last week and it&apos;s now on its way to me.

This game is a blast!  After a few plays I think I have the rules down, and I finally beat the first quest!  I&apos;m currently playing through the 5 quest campaign.  Quests 2 and 3 didn&apos;t go so well, but I&apos;m still having fun and looking forward to playing Quest 4.</body>

I had considered 51st State, Imperial Settlers, and Race for the Galaxy in addition to Terraforming Mars.  I guess those games will have to wait their turn for a spot on my shelf.  </body>

	<body>Yeah, so this is the second game that I&apos;ve bought since my...ahem...game buying moratorium started. I checked the aggregator and can&apos;t believe that there are posts of this game going all the way back to November of last year! I don&apos;t remember seeing it that far back. There are about a dozen of you to blame so I won&apos;t point the finger at anyone specifically, but I am giving all of you the evil eye through the Intertubes (do you feel my stare on you? :angry:)

Haha, read the rules today and hoping to play tonight or tomorrow. The game sounds really cool from my read through of the rules and I learned something new as I was never aware of Hitler&apos;s Commando Order (and no it wasn&apos;t for all of the German soldiers to go without wearing underwear! :laugh:)</body>

	<body>Like so many others in the 1PG, I submitted to the hype (and the coupon price) for this card game.  I&apos;m hoping it lives up to the hype, since I didn&apos;t do as much research on this game as I usually do before I buy.  I haven&apos;t tried it yet, because I&apos;ve been learning to play Star Wars LCG.

	<body>I just ordered this game after having it on my wishlist for almost two year. I always found it too expensive (espacialy shipping). Then my friend [user=Vdesrochers][/user] ordered [thing=192135]Too Many Bones[/thing] and he made me realized that there was shipping options on the Chip Theory Games website and the 30+ usd displayed as estimate could be reduce at 18$. Yeah!

I must blame everybody who posted about it on SGOYT over the years but especialy Vincent because whitout him buying Too Many Bones I may not have bought Hoplomachus!

P.S. Too Many Bones is still too expensive but I realised this year that my position on games being too expensive is really subject to change.</body>

	<body>I was looking for a good Victory Point game. Nemo&apos;s War 2nd Ed. looked really interesting. 
I got the game through the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/171669/1-player-guild-trading-post/page/4?]1 Player Guild Trading Post[/url].
Big thanks to [user=jesberpen][/user] :D

Furthermore I got notified about the availability for [thing=199904][/thing] in an online shop.
[ImageID=3431057]
I was on a wine festival at that time. Just didn&apos;t think about it any further and purchased the game.

There have been plenty of reports about Nemo&apos;s War that interested me, but I have to go back to [listitem=5531393]08-02-17[/listitem] as the first time I considered adding this to my collection. Thanks, C.A!

I finally took the plunge today when I added this onto a preorder for [thing=170604][/thing], with a nice free shipping offer. Hopefully it should be here sometime this autumn, which should give my other games a chance to get to the table before it turns into an undersea adventure!

And on a very random note, this reminds me of a great scene from [i]The Neverending Story[/i]. So many good lines, yet I always loved the description of Captain Nemo (at about the 2:10 mark). So maybe I also need to pick up the book to fully enjoy the theme...

	<body>Now, I nearly regret pulling from the Kickstarter to pass up on this game in favour of supporting several smaller projects. At that time, I wasn&apos;t sure it was something I genuinely wanted as immediately as possible (like with so many Kickstarters). For the longest time, I felt perfectly fine about the whole affair. And then two things happened. First, I discovered SGoYT (I think more accurately it found me). Second, Mars has kept popping up in the threads.

I place this fellow 

[user=rianvdm]

at the core of this mess not only because he was the first to post to this to the August thread and thereby took the first blow to my willpower, but that delicious beverage appealed to my greatest addiction and is my favourite choice while gaming anywhere with anyone. 

My copy of the game came yesterday. </body>

	<body>At the time this Kickstarter was going on, I had already received my copy of Hoplomachus Origins (I think) and decided that it wasn&apos;t for me. When I saw a similar type of setup and a hefty price, I decided to pass and was happy to do so. Fast forward to July this year when I really started to take note of people playing it. I was still fine and decided I could do without until I red the posting of two people. The first was none other than:

After reading his plays, I definitely started to regret missing the Kickstarter, but at that point, there was really nothing I could do. Then I saw the preorders for the second printing and was sorely tempted. Then we get to the beginning of August and beginning of August and another user&apos;s post was the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back. User:

The passion and enthusiasm of these two users really pushed me over and I ordered the game!

	<body>I finally placed an order for three games, actually, but only because [b][thing=199561][/thing][/b] came back in stock, which allowed me to pass that free-shipping threshold. Yes, I can play Sagrada solo, which is great, but it hasn&apos;t received much love on the SGOYT lists with appearances on only four months worth of SGOYT geeklists and none in August. Maybe that will change with the reprint hitting shelves finally.

For the two games that were the &quot;meat&quot; of the order there may be no *one* person to blame since they get posted often enough that there are any number of dozens of people at whom I could point my finger.

Yet, there is a current [thread=1841123]solo challenge[/thread] for [b][thing=169426][/thing][/b] that I&apos;m following even though I don&apos;t yet own the game. So, maybe [user=soylentred][/user] gets the most blame for this purchase. I&apos;ll see you in the challenge as soon as the order gets delivered.

And, I think there is a person I can pinpoint for finally pulling the trigger on [b][thing=167791][/thing][/b]. That honor goes to [user=jgatkinsn][/user] for his [listitem=5609446]entry[/listitem] this month where he proclaimed in his summary &quot;So easy, even a 10-year-old can play it solo!&quot; I&apos;m taking that as a sort of personal challenge. :D

I&apos;m starting to figure out what level of difficulty/complexity/weight/etc., etc., I can tolerate in games, and Terraforming Mars had me shying away, yet with all the entries I read and the enjoyment it&apos;s giving everyone I want to see if I can achieve that same enjoyment. Plus, I&apos;ve read some comments where winning is quite achievable, unlike [thing=121921][/thing], which made it on my Do Not Buy list after months and months of wavering.</body>

As always, I tend to bookmark the very first instance when a game piqued my interest, and it was on [listitem=5529266]August 1, 2017[/listitem] that this so happened! Thanks for the great post that got me interested!

The funny thing is that I&apos;ve consciously avoided anything related to [person=10][/person] since a very bad experience with learning [thing=31260][/thing] years ago. Now, here I am ready to jump into my first Uwe game! Note the word &quot;first&quot; because my wishlist includes many of his games.

Technically this cost me absolutely nothing, courtesy of a gift card to my friendly local game store from my brother. Hurrah for that! How it survived a few months without being used is beyond me.

I also picked up a beautiful set of Chessex dice so that I&apos;m now properly dice-ified! Believe it or not, prior to today I only owned standard d6 dice from games that included them... Now I can actually plan to get into print-and-plays and try out a few other sorts of games. Can&apos;t wait!</body>

Honorable mention also goes to [username=kevinruns262]Kevin[/username] for helping me out with the decision. So I guess there&apos;s some shared blame here? There have also been a few other great posts on the SGoYT list, but I had to draw the blame game line somewhere. Ha!

I already had a chance to try out the basic rules with the [url=http://wmakers.net/deadball]free resources[/url], but now I can start diving deeper into the advanced rules. I don&apos;t consider myself a huge baseball fan, yet my test games produced storylines that I didn&apos;t think possible from just tossing some dice around. The best part is that the rules are completely modular and new ideas are always floating around, so it can be as simple or complex as desired. I&apos;m already planning out a league and a few teams played by who? You guessed it: My [geeklist=230311]Calico Critters[/geeklist]! I&apos;m very happy that I stumbled across this game. Play ball!</body>

You had me at &quot;It&apos;s like playing 7th Continent. But in a book.&quot; Not that I&apos;ve played 7th Continent, but it&apos;s hard to resist a &quot;cooperative or solo gamebook series set in the distant future,&quot; especially at such a reasonable price point. Now that it&apos;s in my hands, I can tell that the compact box is just large enough to include the other gamebooks in the series. Because, yes, of course I got [thing=222338][/thing] at the same time.</body>

Me again! I still have yet to try out the entire world of solo RPGs, although I have a few on my list... Along with many other games! Back in August, Aaron made a [listitem=5546961]great post[/listitem] and mentioned  these decks. I tend to enjoy adding storytelling elements to my games, and even attempt to do some creative writing of my own from time to time. The timing of the post was perfect, for I jumped on board the Kickstarter to take advantage of a nice deal!

I have yet to open the package, but all of my 7 decks arrived! I decided to get them all to cover pretty much every scenario. From nautical to fantasy, horror to steampunk, and more, I&apos;m ready! Even if I only pull a single card for a game, I can see it adding a lot of flavor. There seem to be a lot of uses for these cards, too, so I&apos;m very excited to see what I&apos;ll come up with! Definitely a great addition that will spice up any game or story I play in the future. Thanks, Aaron!

My game budget will be rather tight for the next few months, which is why I&apos;m really happy with this purchase. Even a repetitive game can come to life with a few of these cards!</body>

	<body>I was interested in this game from the start after hearing (mostly) good things about [thing=172818]Above and Below[/thing]. However, I somehow found the Kickstarter pledge levels a little confusing, so I passed. After the game was getting good reviews over the last months I was interested again, but alas, there was no solo mode...

Then came along

who designed an Automa card deck for it. After reminding me of it with his [listitem=5670204]entry on the September 2017 SGOYT list[/listitem] I finally took the plunge and ordered the game last week. I crafted (!) the Automa deck before the game arrived yesterday and I&apos;m eager to try it out.</body>

It was during a quiet afternoon on [listitem=5629661]September 10, 2017[/listitem], when my interest in this game was finally kindled. I saw it several times before, yet it didn&apos;t seem to be quite what I wanted.

Then I saw Suzy&apos;s pictures and lovely description, and I was sold! I purchased it as part of a Kickstarter bundle for [thing=224904][/thing], so I&apos;ll be waiting a few months for it to arrive.

It should be here around springtime of next year, which seems rather fitting. I can&apos;t wait! Both games look to be excellent, and I might even have to break more guild etiquette by playing them with my mom!

Finally, I tend to feel better about supporting projects and games that come from companies and people who care. [person=62511][/person] is a really nice person, and I&apos;m excited to see what&apos;s next for [company=28987][/company]!</body>

I went on the cheap and just picked up the PDF for the base one, but I imagine I&apos;ll pick up at least the fantasy and sci-fi ones before too long.

After not buying any new games last month (because Kickstarters don&apos;t technically count, right?!) I decided to justify a few purchases for the holidays. Not that I think I need any more... Santa&apos;s elves tipped me off that I&apos;ll likely have a sleigh filled with board games!

This rather uncommon game was posted on SGOYT a few times, but it was on [listitem=5795157]November 27, 2017[/listitem] that Brie broke me down completely!

I&apos;ve vaguely enjoyed [thing=199042][/thing], but felt it was missing a lot. Although I don&apos;t intend this one to necessarily fill those needs, the theme and mechanics intrigued me.

It&apos;s rather hard to find, but while ordering something I decided to whip through my wishlist to see if there were any deals. Bingo! [url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J6DYRHI/]Amazon[/url] had a few copies for $69.97 USD... Not bad at all!

The page randomly switches from that price to $158.99: If there&apos;s any interest, I recommend refreshing or checking back every hour or so to see if the price will change.

Now to see if I can really hold off until Christmas before opening this when it arrives next week... I can barely wait! Thanks, Brie! (And my wallet naturally has an angry glare for you today.)</body>

No worries: I&apos;m not cluttering the list too much today! Additionally I found a very small sale on this game, complete with an extra coupon... For $0.45 USD off. What a deal! Ha ha! Iain initially piqued my interest on [listitem=5651815]September 21, 2017[/listitem] and I&apos;ve been keeping an eye on this one.

The fact that it&apos;s a card game is awesome. The minimal play time and chapter-like story with [thing=209323][/thing] (also part of this purchase) make me even more excited!

I might have less time for gaming in the future, so picking up some shorter games is a must. I have a feeling this won&apos;t be absolutely perfect, yet there are a lot of plusses for me. And another upcoming expansion!

Thank you, Iain, and steer clear of my slightly annoyed wallet for a few days. Ha ha!</body>

	<body>Went to the inaugural San Diego FleaCon today.  I was skeptical of the idea of a giant game flea market, but once inside the building, I was impressed.  A [i]lot[/i] of games on offer, from a bunch of sellers.  Lots of activity and a fun time was had.

Anyway, I wasn&apos;t really looking to buy anything (I sold 3 games), but couldn&apos;t resist a $20 KS Edition, Victory Pledge level copy of Draconis Invasion.  Box was opened, but all contents were still in shrink.  Looking forward to trying it out, after reading [user=LGMHorus][/user] posts on SGOYT.

I bought my first steps into the idea of infinite possibilities of games...building other people&apos;s games (the rest of this year and next year and forever) and maybe someday making my own (in like...ten years :D).

[imageid=3898606 medium]

It&apos;s not much but it&apos;s a start. I don&apos;t even know what mod podge is so I need to do some homework and build up my skills and knowledge... 

But at least now I won&apos;t continue ruining our cutting boards and the edges of my books for a straight cutting edge...:laugh:

And I blame 
[floatleft][user=thevig][/user][/floatleft][floatleft][user=govmiller][/user][/floatleft]













I think Janine&apos;s builds are inspiring and Eric&apos;s very visible support of the pnp community is amazing, and both of them unknowingly pushed me into thinking more about and trying to play more pnps.

And a shout out to all the pnp designers whose games I&apos;ve played so far. They&apos;ve been great and I look forward to properly building some new ones.

Here&apos;s to new adventures in 2018. :thumbsup:</body>

But I&apos;ve really enjoyed what people had to say about this game...their words reminded me of my first time trying Arkham Horror LCG, and what a blast I had while the story in those cards unfolded. I&apos;ve also struggled with getting any solo rpgs played but wanting so much to be IN a classic swords and sorcery kind of story so...I bought it.

All goodhearted blame goes to:

	<body>The entries in Oct, Nov, December were great! I watched gameplay video of several modes. Yes, this game is definitely for me. Not easy to find, though.

Lo and behold, today I get a trade offer, a decent fair value one!  I had to recently decide to get rid of both One Deck Dungeons, and why, even though the game is fun, and I have neither tried the expansion, nor the updated rules.

That won&apos;t change the fact that it takes me sixty to seventy minutes, and even if the win rate doubles, it&apos;s still too much time invested and gets a bit repetitive and gets frustrating to die so hard, knowing another game takes that long to try. I could likely improve my time a little with time, but not get it down to forty minutes and under.

Which is what it needs to be. I don&apos;t dislike the dice, but the game is less like going through a dungeon than I thought, and more puzzling which dice go where to do what with. Like what I expect Sagrada to feel like, mostly.

That&apos;s all kind of magnified, I wasn&apos;t hugely dissatisfied with it, it&apos;s a lot of game in a little box, and I am interested in Sagrada.   But I think I would like other things more, and for what I thought this would be, a half hour ish dungeon dicey thing, it isn&apos;t a lot of what I say in that statement. I have other quick games to fill that slot,and more like Friday coming, also because of Sgoyt.

---------

Card City XXL, Puzzley is up my alley,,and the spatially and playing off each other, like what is next to other stuff matters, and the variants,is awesome.

I am aware the rulebook has issues, which is a concern for me, but this game seems so perfect for me, and getting a trade proposal out of the blue, in my birthday month no less, is sweet. Hopefully as more people get the game, player and rule aids will be made. I will do the best with it I can until then.

------

Friday, so many entries, I finally picked it up on the Solo Chain of Generosity.  It&apos;s not frequently expanding like other big name deck builders, so keyword sprawl shouldn&apos;t be bad.  Fast, small footprint, portable. 

------

Fields of Green.  When I heard it had solo variants, on Sgoyt, I decided to get one of the few remaining Kickstarter copies with stretch goals the Game Steward had, because I have watched gameplay and know I will enjoy it, and highly likely my husband will, too.  Hopefully can try it before the expansion Kickstarter ends.

--------

Herbaceous - I was bad and threw a Kickstarter copy of this on at Game Steward too. Everything I have seen tells me I will enjoy it, even though I have not watched video, I have read over a year or whatever of entries.  Very visually pretty, enough so it might distract me in multiplayer . . .

----------

Forbidden Desert- got it for husband last November for 12, to hold for Christmas. It even fit our budget. All the entries brought me around, I had been of the mind Forbidden Island was enough. I&apos;ve played it once before, and it is fun. He really wanted it. So half price, bam.

I should just copy half of this to the Acquisition geekiest. Christmas and birthday it seems . . .

It was on [listitem=5894179]January 14[/listitem] that I took some note of this game, which is more of a framework for creating episodic stories. Since I&apos;ve been getting ready to take the plunge into solo RPGs, this seemed all too perfect!

I really like how it can be more than just a game, creating the foundation for writing. I often struggle to get any stories finished... Not that they&apos;re anything amazing, yet I have such a great time putting them together.

Plus this comes with a set of standard [thing=20545][/thing], which I would love to use for a bunch of other random creative activities! Seemed like a good deal for something that can be used in so many ways.

Which will lead into my next entry on this list in just a moment...</body>

Just a few weeks ago, on [listitem=5910934]January 22[/listitem], I saw an awesome idea with these storytelling dice: Using them to create maps! By no means am I an artist, yet rolling and creating something appeals to me on so many levels.

I picked up the other 9-dice sets beyond the original set. That should make 36 unique dice, with tons of combinations! Eventually I&apos;ll probably pick up the whole collection... Although I&apos;m waiting for the other 9-dice sets to be released for some savings.

I think I&apos;ll be happy with &quot;just&quot; 36 dice for awhile! Can&apos;t wait to use these for solo RPGs, and possibly even with my solo games! I&apos;m looking at you, [thing=71074][/thing], for some additional story points along the journey.</body>

I constantly saw Neanderthal and Greenland posts and thought man they look like great games. I saw that a second edition of each went out on kickstarter and saved the listing to look at later.  I recently got that 48 hour warning in my email... and impulse buy. You&apos;re fault SGOYT... all your fault.

	<body>This comes up periodically.  So when my FLGS had a starter set on clearance for $10 I bought it.  I am a bit nervous as I see complaints about the rules but it is was cheap and I was curious about it (and I am hoping the box is small)!</body>

	<body>Another game I knew about from SGOYT that I was curious.  Another clearance price (NIS first edition for $10).  So another purchase.

You folks got me twice this month even though I have found SGOYT too overwhelming to read lately!

Sara wrote up a beautifully detailed SGOYT entry on [listitem=5976409]02-17-18[/listitem] that made me seriously consider backing this Kickstarter. I was originally intrigued when [user=Zakoholic]Marius[/user] mentioned the game, so I&apos;ll spread the blame a little bit!

I&apos;m definitely leaning more towards narrative games, yet this one has stood out for me as a likely improvement over [thing=183840][/thing] It&apos;s also the type of farming game that seems more up my alley than many of the [person=10][/person] games, although those often tempt me.

Granted, this &quot;purchase&quot; won&apos;t arrive until much later this year, but I like to play the blame game early. Thanks again, Sara! Also, this now holds the record for fastest SGOYT-to-purchase for me at 5 days... Because yes, I track that data. Ha!</body>

I&apos;m at it again! This unique solo RPG that&apos;s more focused on writing has been on my radar for awhile, mainly from the SGOYT entry that Byron began on [listitem=5771951]November 14, 2017.[/listitem] That seems like ages ago...

My game preferences often tend towards themes of community, cuteness, and positivity. However, I&apos;m stretching my creative writing lately and have wanted to write some rather spooky tales. Perfect timing!

To add some intrigue, I plan to use my new sets of [thing=20545][/thing] to draw a vague map for at least one scenario and really get into it. It&apos;s recommended to play this over many nights, letting ideas develop during the day and writing in the darkness of the evening.

I&apos;m excited! I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll still stick to fairly horror-light and family-friendly content with my so-called spooky tales, yet I look forward to trying out something new. The price was also right... Pay-what-you-want!</body>

Reading

Restarts

Reading

Realizing I was doing something wrong that I previously thought I was doing right

Videos

Restart again

Reading

Not yet making it past the first row of terrain (out of 3)

Restart

Similar realization as mentioned above (this happened many times)

Loving every blasted minute of it

My wallet is not happy with me. But I&apos;m still on budget this year, even if it looks like I&apos;m loading up on new games at the moment! There have been a few SGOYT entries about this very new game, but Scott got me with his post on [listitem=6006266]March 4[/listitem].

Funny how my gaming tastes are slowly evolving... I thought I didn&apos;t like combat, yet I tend to prefer the games in my collection that have some combat elements. This one checks so many boxes, not just with its combat, but also the (obvious) hex tiles and exploration.

So now I&apos;m eagerly awaiting this one and looking forward to getting into a game that fits a unique niche in my collection. As always, the sassy wallet is not too pleased... But I am! Thanks, Scott!

[user=splindeman][/user]

made me order it. Thanks!

My 6yo daughter punches out all the games around here. She had me read out all the character&apos;s special abilities while she was busy. After hearing that the [i]Rabble Rouser[/i]&apos;s mastery is &quot;Impressive Belch&quot; she really wanted to play this game.

So today we first made the jigsaw puzzle that you can do if you put all the map pieces upside down. And after that we started our first adventure. As I had a lot of translating and explaining to do before she could make decisions it took us over six hours. That&apos;s also six hours of sound effects by the [i]Rabble Rouser[/i].

Think I got a good grasp on the rules now though. Can&apos;t wait to play this solo.</body>

[user=Zouave][/user]

In spite of some clearly sour-grapes reviews in the forums, the posts by these two trusty SGOYTers, a youtube playthrough video, and my love of the video games convinced me that this was going to be worth picking up.

I have it sleeved, organized, and packed in my bags and am on the train to Windsor to continue working on my new house. Will hopefully have a report up in the next few days.

Looks like an interesting combo of the bonfire-reset of the video game, the grid puzzle-like combat of Too Many Bones, and a loot-filled deck-builder.

It was on [listitem=5885300]January 10[/listitem] that Suzy posted some beautiful pictures of this game in action. Birds? I was doomed.

Although it won&apos;t arrive until later this year, the purchase happened today when I backed the Kickstarter in the last hour or so.

I really tried to resist... Futile. I&apos;m enjoying some lightweight, shorter games lately so this will be a welcome addition! Plus... BIRDIES.

	<body>I have to blame for this one, [user=Albia][/user], with some informing by [user=Teatabletopper][/user] that it was available on auction , with everything and White Whale promo . .

Jessica&apos;s reports, and a couple other people&apos;s helped too, but her reports really showed me a game that looked visually great, with an interesting theme, that can be adapted to non-hunting with a little imagination, if one wishes. 

Because I love the sea,,so much, and I partially grew up back east, and one time my parents just said, let&apos;s drive east, headed towards Mystic, Connecticut,,and see how far we get.  We didn&apos;t get there, but we ended up in a quaint New England town that was a whaling town, a long time ago.  We visited a museum and some other places, but the nautical feel, and learning about whales, and the nostalgic feel of the place, really sunk into me, more than I realized until I started to think about WHY this game was so appealing to me, why there was a little bit of a special feeling there, before I even play.  I hadn&apos;t thought about this trip in quite some time, but it&apos;s a rare positive childhood memory, amongst too much cruelty and indifference.

The posts about this game have brought some of this good, back.  I will assess it on its merits, of course, but I have a soft spot. I do know as a kid, it wasn&apos;t the hunting the whales that interested me, it was other things, the whales a huge part of it.

The guy I bought from, modified the box, by adding the expansion box to it, I will take pictures when I report. It is so neat, and came with the storage and organization he&apos;d added to the game.  

Unfortunately, less than a week after buying it, my husband&apos;s work laid everyone on that contract off, closing this location for it.  UGH!

That&apos;s the way life happens, sometimes.

Anyway, Jessica, and others, thank you for helping connect me back to a really positive memory, and for your great reports,,and informing.  With the replacement tiles, customized box, organization, base and expansion, and promo, this was the perfect configuration for me,,and I value the things I couldn&apos;t do myself, like alter the box,,and so well, too.</body>

	<body>I have some people to blame for this one, which I bought regardless of the fact that the base game is still in shrink. So, without further ado, here they are:

First of all, I blame
[user=repairmanjack][/user]
and
[user=reverendunclebastard][/user]
for recommending it and making it sound like the expansion is hard to get. (Is it?)


There are also
[user=westwardhough][/user]
and
[user=garyrbrooks][/user]
who added to the recommendations.


Of course, [b]all[/b] of this wouldn&apos;t have happened without the (apparently) glorious solo rules by:

	<body>Pretty soon after it’s first appearance here I snagged a copy of this for an excellent price. I can’t say what attracted me, blinded by tartars, the historical flavor, swept up in the Nemo craze so needed something by Verne? 

Seeing [user=suzyvitale][/user] play through reignited its initial excitement.  Also, tomorrow I might be able to play it multi-player, we potentially have five so this game hits that spot, giving me the excuse to learn it. 

It was hard. I lost.  It moved pretty quickly once I internalized everything, about 15 minutes to learn it from reading manual to third or fourth turn? I’m going to reread to see if I made any mistakes (I gorged on the helpers and I suspect you are only allowed to use one a turn).

I&apos;ve been leaning more and more towards solo RPGs lately, which led me back to the old days of random gamebooks I used to play. I&apos;ve seen these gamebooks mentioned time and time again, so they&apos;ve never strayed far from my radar.

Blame it on illness (or mostly on Kevin from his entry on [listitem=6198662]June 10[/listitem]) but I finally caved yesterday! There is something I love about using paper and a writing utensil whenever possible. Let&apos;s just say I didn&apos;t only pick up a single book...

Large format editions are all on their way! Surprisingly, I seem to have a very early delivery estimate of tomorrow for a handful of them. I&apos;m looking forward to getting started on this series!</body>

	<body>Reports here on this, plus my own research, had me jumping on this on the Two player fair trade it forward when it was up.  I am aware of a couple things many or some view as a minus, but either I feel the house rule others have come up with solves the Towers deciding the game issue, or I don&apos;t think the other thing or two are negatives based on what I like.  If AP on being able to completely rebuild becomes an issue in multiplayer, I could house rule it to only allow a certain number of times to be rearranged.

I feel this could become one of those relaxing, maybe even Zen like, games that aren&apos;t too much especially when I am waking up.  I really love how visual it is, and that there&apos;s a different detail on each tile. I don&apos;t expect much depth out of the gameplay, but just a few types of decisions that will entertain, especially on overwhelmed days, or sick, or whatnot.

The fact that we enjoy Colorpop which often comes down to a tiebreaker, and changes how we play in interesting ways because of that, also lends to me feeling like the game&apos;s multiplayer scores usually being close, is fine for me.

Further games Sgoyt made me get, are [thing=160744][/thing] from the Solitaire Fair trade it forward list, and [thing=60737][/thing].  My husband will be printing off some aids and stuff at the library tomorrow.

Last but not least, I won [thing=234669][/thing] today, from an Every Night is Game Night (Engn) contest on bgg.  Thanks Engn, and any sponsors that may have assisted!  I chose this from a choice of three, in large part because of Sgoyt.  Comancheria and Hoplomachus: Origins aren&apos;t my type of game, though fun for others!

I have managed to get rid of some games this week as well, so that balances things.

This post only cost me $1.99 plus a quarter for library printing, if you don&apos;t count shipping games out.</body>

	<body>I just ordered a bunch of games. (Finally got around to spending my Xmas money). My main criteria was that they play well solo as well as multiplayer.

The many great write ups on SGOYT are directly responsible for the purchase of Sunset Over Water and Herbaceous.

The other purchases are Flash Point + 3 expansions, Sagrada and Clank! Sunken Treasures - SGOYT is not directly responsible for these, but I&apos;ll assign part of the blame to it anyway. </body>

	<body>My second SGOYT MMBT (I&apos;ve only been following the list for 3 months) arrived yesterday!

I can really see what people like about this game... it&apos;s got great components, wonderful artwork, its not &quot;heavy&quot; but does involve deep strategy, its got dice but you get a lot of ways to mitigate bad rolls, tells a fantastic story that changes each time you play, four different paths to focus on for each game and a way to change to another mid-game... I could probably go on in this vein for a while.

Really thrilled I picked this one up.

Thanks SGOYT!</body>

I realized I forgot to point a finger and play the blame game when I Kickstarted this one last month! Not only did Benjamin co-design the solo variant, but I&apos;ve had my eye on this game since his SGOYT entry on [listitem=5809500]December 3, 2017[/listitem].

This also makes it the longest time from going on my wishlist to purchase, and technically that&apos;s even longer with the waiting! Yet I&apos;m sure it will be well worth it.

I&apos;m really looking forward to the unique theme and mountain of components. My game table certainly needs to put to the test! Although my solo gaming time may have fallen off a bit lately, I&apos;m also excited to introduce this to my brother.

My wallet may grumble and offer up some very nasty glances, but thank you very much, Benjamin!</body>

And now for something completely different for me... This one caught my attention when Paul posted about it recently on [listitem=6251572]July 13[/listitem]. The narrative potential drew me right in, although I wasn&apos;t too thrilled about the price.

Things became even more interesting when I started following along with [geeklist=243374]The 1 Player Guild Plays Codeword Cromwell[/geeklist]. No spoilers, but suffice to say that my character had something happen right near the beginning.

It&apos;s definitely the narrative potential that has me intrigued, but the whole game seems interesting! Mechanically speaking, it may not be anything amazing, yet I fully believe that some games should be enjoyed as experiences with memorable stories.

I can&apos;t wait for this one to arrive! I appreciate all the details and help, Paul! For once, my wallet can&apos;t complain: Thank goodness I had birthday money that made the price point less painful. Ha!

is still the only person to have mentioned this game on SGOYT, and it was an insta-buy for me. Low price, and not a needy game, just a deck of cards, plus a fantasy theme...it seemed like a good one for a future very-busy dad-to-be.

I agree with [listitem=6297705]Jacob about the card stock[/listitem] so I might look into sleeves, but so far I like this one. Simple mechanics, kin in some ways to One Deck Dungeon but less work to play it (no dice, no tokens at all to manage), so this might see more action than ODD.

And I really like how easy it is to pause the game...this one will definitely get some use over the next four months...</body>

[b][size=18]Orchard: A 9 Card Solitaire Game[/size][/b]

I&apos;ve been trying to avoid purchasing too many new games this year, or at least cut down on the really expensive purchases. This seemed like a good choice, particularly after a recent entry on [listitem=6371480]September 11[/listitem]!

The monthly challenges have intrigued me, too, and I&apos;m looking forward to enjoying a bit of tabletop harvesting. Shorter, smaller games have been appealing to me lately, too. Can&apos;t wait for this to arrive!

There are many others whom I could blame, but this was the entry that made me take a look at the printed version from [url=https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/orchard-9-card-solitaire-game]The Game Crafter[/url]. Nice to have that option for those of us whose crafting skills need to level up!

They appear in every page of SCOYT testing variants of the game. But time back this game was realeased here in Brazil but didn&apos;t give much attention coz I was so addicted to Lord of the Rings LCG that din&apos;t search about it. But now, looking for them playing it and after discoreved that existis a Cauldron FanMade Expansion, it pushes me to give it a try. I&apos;m of hope of so much great time as it &apos;ll fit the gap between LotR in way of time needed to deck building as I think SotM is more easy to put on table and play.

well, &apos;ll see</body>

	<body>Didn&apos;t realize this came out this year. Ricky Royal&apos;s game.

Been seeing this on SGOYT for the last few months, and usually, I detest deck builders, but that is because that&apos;s usually the only thing they do. I need more mechanics going on than that, and this has it. 

I love that its coop which means my wife will play it with me. It&apos;s not super complex so we can actually bring in some friends too.

Seeing the theme and aesthetic in the pictures people are posting on SGOYT is what really sold me though. It looks really cool. I don&apos;t think I have a hacking cyberpunk themed game either.  </body>

And I threw in the expansion into the cart as well because why not? :d</body>

	<body>This first came to my attention during last year&apos;s Top 100 list when [user=de_la_poer][/user] so memorably lamented its fall. Then others began posting with cool looking terrain hexes from [thing=151979][/thing], and my interest was further piqued. I finally bit when a friend asked for more orders to fill out a MM order to get free shipping when they had their deep discount moving sale in August. I got it from my friend in late September and have enjoyed one game so far.

Oh, I think Andreas might also be to blame for me owning a Oregon Laminations corner rounder and having already clipped all my chits.</body>

	<body>I absolutely blame BBG&apos;s solo guild for this purchase. Today I broke it open and tried to get a hold of the rules together with my mostly-non-gaming wife (sometimes she does surprise me), but the lengthy rules (for her taste) made this an aborted run. 

She did comment on how great the game looks and once I have absorbed the rules (by my own), I guess we can give it another chance. 

So now it definitely is on my huge stack of this year&apos;s (in this case Essen) purchases designated for solo play. </body>

	<body>Supposedly [person=76227][/person] makes great solo modes - I still have to try it for this one. He offered to sign it, but I still had to lug all the loot to the shuttle bus and then across a few acres of parking lot - so I preferred to leave the shrink-wrap on (to protect against potential rain). 

[imageid=4382781 medium]

BTW - this is the queue to the shuttle bus from parking lot P10 to the fair grounds. As we were halfway down the queue, a family passed us looking for the end of the queue and a little girl said in a very astonished voice &quot;Mama, there is not even an end to the line!&quot; That was pretty funny at the time.

Given the distance to the car, the ability to carry was the limiting factor for purchasing games this year, not the wallet. And that despite the two little mules I had brought...

The game board itself is absolutely huge. I hope the game itself is as good as the eye candy.

That&apos;s three solo(-able) games in the bag, there&apos;s only four more to go/unwrap. I think.</body>

	<body>The fourth of my solo-purposed purchases in Essen. 

Still miffed about them not having the full range of it there, only picked up Tink as an add-on. 

But I likely should be grateful - any more weight on my shoulders and I might have been able to lug everything back to the car.

But buying this is definitely SGOYT&apos;s fault. Everything is. Too bad my wife won&apos;t see reason. She seems to think it&apos;s some sort of character fault of MINE. Preposterous!</body>

Not SGOYT directly. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve seen him post lately. I figured this is a good place to post though considering it&apos;s 1pg.

Been seeing him post about how the base is better than War Eternal, and the first cycle of expansions are better than outer dark and void. (of which I own all 3)

Now I just need to figure out how to store it all. My best cheapest bet seems to be sacrificing a box by cutting it to accommodate cards and player boards.</body>

I already have a bunch of appropriate terrain, but given that I was given a healthy bonus from the job I just left in Toronto (I am moving to Windsor), I also picked up some additional terrain including the Red Rocket set and some awesome stuff from Plast Craft.

I saw this on sale on Amazon for $22.99 (11/16/18) with Prime shipping (free for Prime members).  Not only that... I had plenty of points to pay for it without opening the wallet!

Of course, I had to clear it with my wife first, since we usually reserve though Prime points for other things. She&apos;s so sweet!

It was back on [listitem=5923568]January 28[/listitem] that I started to think about this one. The artwork is darker and scarier than what I usually prefer... But how pretty!

So this year I&apos;ve been secretly looking into this one constantly. Every month or so, I would almost go in for a late pledge. Almost.

Finally, I took the plunge today! This won&apos;t arrive until next year, but that purchase definitely happened today. Oh, and maybe [thing=155065][/thing] got added, too.

An early merry Christmas to myself! And thank you for the fantastic photos and report, Darla! My wallet would like to ignore you for the foreseeable future, though. Ha!</body>

After [listitem=6588646]Jessica&apos;s [b]post[/b] on Sunday[/listitem]...and Kevin&apos;s response, I couldn&apos;t stop myself from pulling the trigger when I found a shrink-wrapped copy of this locally. After only watching a few videos and playing through the basic game I&apos;m very glad I did! The game is gorgeous. I love the theme. And, the dynamic challenge the puzzle presents is fantastic (it&apos;s the wizarding world co-op I&apos;ve been missing).

[floatright][user=kerskine][/user][/floatright]Kevin&apos;s [url=http://sgoyt.onesuponagame.com/detail/game/154895/wizards-academy]SGOYT Aggregator[/url] is a great spot to quickly find all the gorgeous entries for Wizard&apos;s Academy. I&apos;ve read so many that I feel like I&apos;ve already played a 10x10 of it! Thank you SGOYT for introducing me to this wonderful gem! [q=&quot;kerskine&quot;]I love seeing you post about this game. It&apos;s such a fantastic puzzle every time. If this was widely distributed, this could easily be a top 20 game for solo gamers.[/q]

	<body>You know you have a serious retail therapy problem when a short while after Essen you visit your game store and come out with an even larger stash (in my defense, this time I had three mules, but they all bought their own games, too).

Spirit Island is the first and so far I only have read the rules and watch a few videos, but haven&apos;t gotten my own play in.

This purchase allowed me to circumvent the (more or less) recent Spirit Island Kickstarter, which would have been a relatively huge expense combined with a long wait.

* Corsair Leader :thumbsup:

	<body>I decided I wanted to binge through all of the abductors and made it through Arkayne and Donna yesterday.

Lost both horribly. My dice rolling is back and it was pointless even trying. Donna killed 6 before I could get one saved. I couldn&apos;t get communication points or reduse the threat level on a roll period. Had to use cards to give me a single success or not at all and discard cards for communication points if I wanted any. It was brutal and I usually do good against these two.

Next up is Quinn.</body>

[thread=2129167][/thread]

I am sure 2019 discussions will start up and based on the fact that there have been only 4 sessions in 2018 you can see that it isn&apos;t that big of a time suck or commitment plus it is fun.

If any of you fabulous people would like to give it a shot let me know.</body>

It was back on [listitem=6482796]October 19, 2018[/listitem], when I was first made painfully aware that I neglected to back this lovely game. I passed it over like an invitation to a party at a distant relative&apos;s country estate.

In other words, it seemed quite intriguing and lovely, but not something I could be bothered with at the moment. Not important enough, nor high enough on the social ladder.

Then suddenly, said distant relative received a surprise inheritance and was the talk of the county. I simply had to oblige: What sort of classless lady would I be if I didn&apos;t jump at the opportunity?!

Also, I may have started rewatching [i]Downton Abbey[/i] yesterday and couldn&apos;t resist having a game that could create some vaguely similar storylines... Most likely with well-dressed Calico Critters.
[clear]
Thanks, Walter! I am trying to seriously limit my purchases this year, which may sound ridiculous with the rate I usually acquire games, but so far I&apos;ve passed on several projects I normally would have jumped at. Progress!

Something also has to be said about the designer&apos;s clear &quot;obsession&quot; with making this game something amazing. That amount of passion for a game, coupled with active engagement with the community, have me very excited for this one to arrive!</body>

Recently sold some games and the money was burning a hole in my pocket. I almost bought this last year from the publisher&apos;s shop in Portland while I was there for work and chickened out in a fit of social anxiety. Next time I&apos;m there, I&apos;ll venture another trip to their shop for expansions.</body>

[user=Angie666][/user]

posted about it on the recent SGOYT thread ([listitem=6665585]link[/listitem]) and it was back on my radar. While reading her entry I saw that she was selling the basic version so I sent her a GeekMail asking about shipping costs. Some mere minutes later I had an answer and bought the game from her.

The icing on the cake is that it&apos;s already sleeved so I don&apos;t have to buy more sleeves (although I generally enjoy sorting and sleeving my games).</body>

	<body>[user=DocSavage2001][/user] posts plays of all of the PACG games.  Each one shows off the lovely artwork contained within.  So when someone was selling Rise of the Runelords + Character Add-On + Adventure Packs 2-6 for $30, all sealed, I was extremely tempted.  A quick GM exchange with Dave, and a run through of Ricky Royal&apos;s videos, and I was ready to commit.  Got the game on Saturday, and true as advertised, it was in great condition, and even came with a few extra promo cards.

Can&apos;t wait to give it a try.  The only negative is the box size, which is massive.

I went to DTRPG for [thing=93970][/thing], but thanks to rev&apos;s postings on this game in SGoYT and otherwise I finally caved. I knew I would end up owning it eventually, so why not. The initiative system and showdowns are pretty intriguing, and If I don&apos;t get to it, it&apos;s better than dropping on a skirmish game that comes with expensive minis.

Also picked up Tomb of the Serpent King for solo and horror rules. Figure it will play nice with a lot of the Descent monster minis. I can always proxy fantasy, wasteland, or sci-fi for the pulp theme.

Now to print these beasts.</body>

I also got the KS Extras, dice tower, which I saw someone sporting on one of their posts... and the wooden die, and some extra score pads, and [thing=47389][/thing].

Bad thing, though. The shipping was more expensive than the items I payed for. I also had to pay customs of almost $30 for picking it up from the post office. My poor wallet... :cry:</body>

First some more fun facts: 

Fitting to this game I sacrificed the [thing=141648]Daybreak Expansion[/thing] from Battlestar Galactica in order to acquire this gem. (Hey, I even got Rosenberg&apos;s [thing=234277]Nusfjord[/thing] for it in a trade)

I couldn&apos;t even resist to latepledge [thing=257602]Mean Streets[/thing] along with the World books and all extra Adventurers. 

SGOYT is not on my subscriptions list.:D

Fellow europeans: The late pledge manager for Mean Streets is open until February 28th including all available stuff: last chance to save a lot of shipping charges. If you don&apos;t like it after it has arrived, there will be an european thankful to you after you sold or traded it to him or her.

Probably a few people to blame, but I&apos;m going to pile on Jessica for her long beautiful posts about the game. 

I don&apos;t even like euros, which I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s what this is, but for some reason I&apos;ve always been fascinated by Victorian England, so the theme got to me. It didn&apos;t seem likely that I&apos;d get anyone to trade it, so now it&apos;s on it&apos;s way.

I need to go kill orcs or something to get back to normal. I can&apos;t believe you made me do this Jessica. It&apos;s some kind of evil power you wield!</body>

Although I&apos;ve taken note of some recent entries, it was the one on [listitem=6772590]February 28[/listitem] that convinced me this one might be a good idea to add to my collection!

Definitely not what anyone was expecting for me... Angelika is going to be blamed soon, but a few things came up that took away some of my board game budget. Now I can only dream of bigger games for a little bit. Ha!

The comment that this one beats [thing=156336][/thing] piqued my interest. And at just over $10 USD, it was a pretty easy decision to add it to my order. I&apos;m looking forward to its arrival!

	<body>As a fan of Uwe&apos;s games, and after seeing this here every monthly list, it was just a matter of WHEN was I going to get this game, not IF I would get it :p</body>

	<body>First time blaming! And there&apos;s lots to go around for this game!

I first learned about this game through a gorgeous post from 

[user=Albia][/user].

I was immediately taken in by the colors, theme, and minis. (And while theme has always been important to me, normally, I try not to be swayed by things like production! And I have never cared about minis before. It turns out, that&apos;s because I don&apos;t really like dungeony themes. It&apos;s very different (alas!) when the minis are avatars of different human emotions!)

But, I was holding out because I have lots of underplayed heavy euros that have trouble getting table time.

But then, some posts from 

[user=philjc][/user] 

built up my excitement.

Finally, it was 

[user=mournful][/user] 

who really sealed my fate with respect to this game! It&apos;s one of the most awesome things in the hobby when Luke begins to play a game that you&apos;re really interested in reading about! So I found myself a copy and made sure it had the painted minis...

A few days after I ordered the game, Luke discovered what seems to be a flaw in the solo AI. At least one other user seems to have independently found and posted about an over-powerful strategy against the AI too.

And then, the package got lost in the mail for two weeks. :( The good news is, it eventually got found and was delivered to me yesterday!

I&apos;m trying to decide whether to play it or try to move it on while it&apos;s still in shrink, given the question mark regarding solo play. It&apos;s also possible the designers will figure out a fix! That is what I&apos;m hoping!</body>

I&apos;ve had this game on my radar for the longest time... Literally! It was Tim&apos;s entry back on [listitem=5567084]August 19, 2017[/listitem], that caught my attention. Talk about an impactful first post!

Although the theme certainly isn&apos;t one to label as &quot;fun&quot; by any means, I was intrigued by the emotional impact the experience could lead to. So I waited and continued to read many positive reports.

There was a copy at my friendly local game store that I planned to purchase about a week ago... And someone beat me to it after it sat there for a few years! Talk about bad luck.[clear]My trip to Meeplemart a few days ago was fortunate, though, as there were a few copies of this one on the shelf. I knew I had to have it, at long last. I&apos;m looking forward to getting it to the table!

[i]Also, advance apologies for the string of blame I&apos;m about to spam this list with. If it&apos;s an issue, I&apos;ll gladly consolidate! Just let me know, but I am going to try not to post everything all at once. Key word: &quot;Try.&quot;[/i]</body>

I was already a [thing=123955][/thing] fan.  Their posts and conversations put me over the edge to give this a try.  Fun game!</body>

I mean... How could I not?! Ann mentioned how she played this solo on [listitem=6644524]January 8[/listitem]. There are elephants. ELEPHANTS! And far too many people were puzzled why I didn&apos;t own this already. Ha!

Granted, it&apos;s not really designed to be played solo, yet it sounds like there&apos;s a fun, lightweight puzzle. And elephants!

Plus for the price I paid, the 10 custom wooden elephants were worth it. More Stealthy Elephants for me to hide with other games! Thanks, Ann![clear]</body>

Monica has been posting about this one for a few months, and I&apos;ve always had a little laugh about the way she describes her sessions! It was the one on [listitem=6621891]December 31[/listitem] that got me vaguely interested.

I hadn&apos;t planned on picking this one up, possibly ever. Yet there I was in Meeplemart, all excited about the games. So many games! This one was shelved improperly in a random section. That was my hint!

Granted, I&apos;m not expecting this one to be the best game ever. I am, however, looking forward to following in Monica&apos;s footsteps and having a little laugh about the rather macabre theme.

Also, my wallet didn&apos;t really suffer with this one. So Monica, you&apos;re still on my &quot;safe&quot; list for the moment. Ha ha![clear]</body>

Hold onto those hats for an odd tale. Black Angelique, as Angelika is often known as, has tempted me far too much with games like [thing=192296][/thing] and [thing=82222][/thing].

And yet I&apos;ve somehow resisted. However, her report on [listitem=6815276]March 22[/listitem] about the base game made me seriously think about finding this expansion. Call me silly... I really disliked elements of the base game!

Yet in the clearance/damaged section of Meeplemart, I found it on sale. Maybe it&apos;s foolish to keep giving this one more and more chances, yet I want to! Maybe there will be a good lesson in here, no matter what happens.

Angelika&apos;s excitement about the base game makes me eager to make it the first game I&apos;ve taken off of my retired list. Here&apos;s to hoping things pan out, particularly if I can get the narrative going as I&apos;ve been wanting to![clear]</body>

Dimitri is constantly posting about his excellent adventures with this entire franchise, and it was back on [listitem=6183505]June 4[/listitem] that I finally took notice. Maybe it was the Stealthy Elephant he used? Ha ha!

My friendly local game store has had a copy of every expansion in stock for a year... Except this one, which is what&apos;s needed to play solo! So when I saw it at Meeplemart, I knew I needed it.

This is also a potential shout out to Dimitri about some blame for [thing=40210][/thing] and [thing=66121][/thing]. Most likely...

I&apos;m actually really thrilled about this one because my base game has been abandoned for so very long. A new life is right on the horizon: Thanks, Dimitri![clear]</body>
